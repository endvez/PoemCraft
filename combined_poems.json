First, methought\nI stood not in the smile of heaven, who had\nCommanded nature that my lady's womb,\nIf it conceived a male child by me, should\nDo no more offices of life to 't than\nThe grave does to th' dead, for her male issue\nOr died where they were made, or shortly after\nThis world had aired them. Hence I took a thought\nThis was a judgment on me, that my kingdom,\nWell worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not\nBe gladded in 't by me. Then follows that\nI weighed the danger which my realms stood in\nBy this my issue's fail, and that gave to me\nMany a groaning throe. Thus hulling in\nThe wild sea of my conscience, I did steer\nToward this remedy whereupon we are\nNow present here together. That's to say,\nI meant to rectify my conscience, which\nI then did feel full sick, and yet not well,\nBy all the reverend fathers of the land\nAnd doctors learned.

  {
    "text": "It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry we mean to the simple love of the antique and that, again, a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings should be ascribed to a fact which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and with the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems.\n\nAlmost every devout admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the author's will, and is altogether apart from his intention.\n\nWords and their rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction, a very commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems now we mean it only as against the poets thew. There is a growing desire to overrate them. The old\nEnglish muse was frank, guileless, sincere, and although very learned, still learned without art. No general error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworth and Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end with the two latter the means. The poet of the \"Creation\" wished, by highly artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth the poet of the \"Ancient Mariner\" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment through channels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a path which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude. But in this view even the \"metaphysical verse\" of Cowley is but evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And he was in this but a type of his school for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character. They used little art in composition. Their writings sprang immediately from the soul and partook intensely of that soul's nature.\n\nNor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind but, again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility, as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one (ceteris paribus) more artificial.\n\nWe can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the \"Book of Gems\" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school but if the intention had been merely to show the school's character, the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity.. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. His opinion, for example, of Sir Henry Wotton's \"Verses on the Queen of Bohemia\", that \"there are few finer things in our language,\" is untenable and absurd.\n\nIn such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of Poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time. Here every thing is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. No prepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine no other prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments, stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and without even an attempt at adaptation.\n\nIn common with all the world, we have been much delighted with \"The Shepherd's Hunting\" by Withers, a poem partaking, in a remarkable degree, of the peculiarities of \"Il Penseroso.\" Speaking of Poesy the author says:\n\n\"By the murmur of a spring,\nOr the least boughs rustleling,\nBy a daisy whose leaves spread,\nShut when Titan goes to bed,\nOr a shady bush or tree,\nShe could more infuse in me\nThan all Nature's beauties can\nIn some other wiser man.\nBy her help I also now\nMake this churlish place allow\nSomething that may sweeten gladness\nIn the very gall of sadness,\nThe dull loneness, the black shade,\nThat these hanging vaults have made\nThe strange music of the waves\nBeating on these hollow caves,\nThis black den which rocks emboss,\nOvergrown with eldest moss,\nThe rude portals that give light\nMore to terror than delight,\nThis my chamber of neglect\n\nWalled about with disrespect;\nFrom all these and this dull air\nA fit object for despair,\nShe hath taught me by her might\nTo draw comfort and delight.\"\n\nBut these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general character of the English antique. Something more of this will be found in Corbet's \"Farewell to the Fairies!\" We copy a portion of Marvell's \"Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,\" which we prefer not only as a specimen of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness to anything of its species:\n\n\"It is a wondrous thing how fleet\n'Twas on those little silver feet,\nWith what a pretty skipping grace\nIt oft would challenge me the race,\nAnd when't had left me far away\n'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;\nFor it was nimbler much than hinds,\nAnd trod as if on the four winds.\nI have a garden of my own,\nBut so with roses overgrown,\nAnd lilies, that you would it guess\nTo be a little wilderness;\nAnd all the spring-time of the year\nIt only loved to be there.\nAmong the beds of lilies I\nHave sought it oft where it should lie,\nYet could not, till itself would rise,\nFind it, although before mine eyes.\nFor in the flaxen lilies' shade\nIt like a bank of lilies laid;\nUpon the roses it would feed\nUntil its lips even seemed to bleed,\nAnd then to me 'twould boldly trip,\nAnd print those roses on my lip,\nBut all its chief delight was still\nWith roses thus itself to fill,\nAnd its pure virgin limbs to fold\nIn whitest sheets of lilies cold.\nHad it lived long, it would have been\nLilies without, roses within.\"\n\nHow truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! It pervades all.. It comes over the sweet melody of the words over the gentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself even over the half playful, half petulant air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, \"and all sweet flowers.\" The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or the artlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief, or the fragrance and warmth and appropriateness of the little nest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay upon them, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile on her face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quotedthe wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite the \"little silver feet\", the fawn challenging his mistress to a race with \"a pretty skipping grace,\" running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting her approach only to fly from it again can we not distinctly perceive all these things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,\n\n\"And trod as if on the four winds!\"\n\nA vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Then consider the garden of \"my own,\" so overgrown, entangled with roses and lilies, as to be \"a little wilderness\", the fawn loving to be there, and there \"only\", the maiden seeking it \"where it should lie\", and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until \"itself would rise\", the lying among the lilies \"like a bank of lilies\", the loving to \"fill itself with roses,\"\n\n\"And its pure virgin limbs to fold\nIn whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"\n\nand these things being its \"chief\" delights and then the pre-eminent beauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperbole only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence, the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child,\n\n\"Had it lived long, it would have been Lilies without, roses within.\"",

Oh, I am very happy!\n\nAless.                    Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing\nThy happiness, what ails thee, cousin of mine?\nWhy didst thou sigh so deeply?\n\nCas.                        Did I sigh?\nI was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,\nA silly, a most silly fashion I have\nWhen I am very happy. Did I sigh? (sighing.)\n\nAless.                    Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged\nToo much of late, and I am vexed to see it.\nLate hours and wine, Castiglione,, these\nWill ruin thee! thou art already altered,\nThy looks are haggard, nothing so wears away\nThe constitution as late hours and wine.\n\nCas. (musing ). Nothing, fair cousin, nothing,\nNot even deep sorrow,\nWears it away like evil hours and wine.\nI will amend.\n\nAless.                    Do it! I would have thee drop\nThy riotous company, too, fellows low born\nIll suit the like of old Di Broglio�s heir\nAnd Alessandra�s husband.\n\nCas.                        I will drop them.\n\nAless.                    Thou wilt, thou must. Attend thou also more\nTo thy dress and equipage, they are over plain\nFor thy lofty rank and fashion, much depends\nUpon appearances.\n\nCas.                        I�ll see to it.\n\nAless.                    Then see to it!, pay more attention, sir,\nTo a becoming carriage, much thou wantest\nIn dignity.\n\nCas.                        Much, much, oh, much I want\nIn proper dignity.\n\nAless.\n(haughtily).         Thou mockest me, sir!\n\nCos.\n(abstractedly).    Sweet, gentle Lalage!\n\nAless.                    Heard I aright?\nI speak to him, he speaks of Lalage?\nSir Count!\n(places her hand on his shoulder)\nwhat art thou dreaming?\nHe�s not well!\nWhat ails thee, sir?\n\nCas.(starting).

Jacinta,, now indeed, Jacinta,\nI thought not of the jewels.\n\nJac.                        Oh, perhaps not!\nBut then I might have sworn it. After all,\nThere�s Ugo says the ring is only paste,\nFor he�s sure the Count Castiglione never\nWould have given a real diamond to such as you;\nAnd at the best I�m certain, madam, you cannot\nHave use for jewels now. But I might have sworn it.\n\n(Exit)\n\n(Lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table, after a\nshort pause raises it.)\n\nLal.                        Poor Lalage!, and is it come to this?\nThy servant maid!, but courage!, �tis but a viper\nWhom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!\n(taking up the mirror)\nHa! here at least�s a friend, too much a friend\nIn earlier days, a friend will not deceive thee.\nFair mirror and true! now tell me (for thou canst)\nA tale, a pretty tale, and heed thou not\nThough it be rife with woe.

I cannot pray,\nThe sweet airs from the garden worry me!\nThy presence grieves me, go!, thy priestly raiment\nFills me with dread, thy ebony crucifix\nWith horror and awe!\n\nMonk.                     Think of thy precious soul!\n\nLal.                        Think of my early days!, think of my father\nAnd mother in Heaven! think of our quiet home,\nAnd the rivulet that ran before the door!\nThink of my little sisters!, think of them!\nAnd think of me!, think of my trusting love\nAnd confidence, his vows, my ruin, think, think\nOf my unspeakable misery!, , begone!\nYet stay! yet stay!, what was it thou saidst of prayer\nAnd penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith\nAnd vows before the throne?\n\nMonk.                     I did.\n\nLal.                        �Tis well.\nThere is a vow �twere fitting should be made,\nA sacred vow, imperative and urgent,\nA solemn vow!\n\nMonk.                     Daughter, this zeal is well!\n\nLal.                        Father, this zeal is anything but well!\nHast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?\nA crucifix whereon to register\nThis sacred vow? (he hands her his own.)\nNot that, Oh! no!, no!, no (shuddering.)\nNot that! Not that!, I tell thee, holy man,\nThy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!\nStand back! I have a crucifix myself,,\nI have a crucifix! Methinks �twere fitting\nThe deed, the vow, the symbol of the deed,\nAnd the deed�s register should tally, father!\n(draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high.)\nBehold the cross wherewith a vow like mine\nIs written in heaven!\n\nMonk.                     Thy words are madness, daughter,\nAnd speak a purpose unholy, thy lips are livid,\nThine eyes are wild, tempt not the wrath divine!\nPause ere too late!, oh, be not, be not rash!\nSwear not the oath, oh, swear it not!\n\nLal.                        �Tis sworn!\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAn Apartment in a Palace. POLITIAN and BALDAZZAR.\n\n\nBaldazzar.            Arouse thee now, Politian!\nThou must not, nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not\nGive way unto these humors. Be thyself!\nShake off the idle fancies that beset thee\nAnd live, for now thou diest!\n\nPolitian.             Not so, Baldazzar!\nSurely I live.\n\nBal.                        Politian, it doth grieve me\nTo see thee thus!\n\nPol.                        Baldazzar, it doth grieve me\nTo give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.\nCommand me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?\nAt thy behest I will shake off that nature\nWhich from my forefathers I did inherit,\nWhich with my mother�s milk I did imbibe,\nAnd be no more Politian, but some other.\nCommand me, sir!\n\nBal.                        To the field then, to the field,\nTo the senate or the field.\n\nPol.                        Alas! alas!\nThere is an imp would follow me even there!\nThere is an imp hath followed me even there!\nThere is, what voice was that?\n\nBal.                        I heard it not.\nI heard not any voice except thine own,\nAnd the echo of thine own.\n\nPol.                        Then I but dreamed.\n\nBal.                        Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp, the court\nBefit thee, Fame awaits thee, Glory calls,\nAnd her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear\nIn hearkening to imaginary sounds\nAnd phantom voices.\n\nPol.                        It is a phantom voice!\nDidst thou not hear it then?\n\nBal                         I heard it not.\n\nPol.                        Thou heardst it not!, Baldazzar, speak no more\nTo me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.\nOh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,\nOf the hollow and high-sounding vanities\nOf the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile\nWe have been boys together, school-fellows,\nAnd now are friends, yet shall not be so long,\nFor in the Eternal City thou shalt do me\nA kind and gentle office, and a Power,\nA Power august, benignant, and supreme,\nShall then absolve thee of all further duties\nUnto thy friend.\n\nBal.                        Thou speakest a fearful riddle\nI will not understand.\n\nPol.                        Yet now as Fate\nApproaches, and the Hours are breathing low,\nThe sands of Time are changed to golden grains,\nAnd dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!\nI cannot die, having within my heart\nSo keen a relish for the beautiful\nAs hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air\nIs balmier now than it was wont to be,\nRich melodies are floating in the winds,\nA rarer loveliness bedecks the earth,\nAnd with a holier lustre the quiet moon\nSitteth in Heaven., Hist! hist! thou canst not say\nThou hearest not now, Baldazzar?\n\nBal.                        Indeed I hear not.\n\nPol.                        Not hear it!, listen, now, listen!, the faintest sound\nAnd yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!\nA lady�s voice!, and sorrow in the tone!\nBaldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!\nAgain!, again!, how solemnly it falls\nInto my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice\nSurely I never heard, yet it were well\nHad I but heard it with its thrilling tones\nIn earlier days!\n\nBal.                        I myself hear it now.\nBe still!, the voice, if I mistake not greatly,\nProceeds from younder lattice, which you may see\nVery plainly through the window, it belongs,\nDoes it not? unto this palace of the Duke.\nThe singer is undoubtedly beneath\nThe roof of his Excellency, and perhaps\nIs even that Alessandra of whom he spoke\nAs the betrothed of Castiglione,\nHis son and heir.\n\nPol.                        Be still!, it comes again!\n\nVoice\n(very faintly). �And is thy heart so strong\nAs for to leave me thus,\nThat have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among?\nAnd is thy heart so strong\nAs for to leave me thus?\nSay nay! say nay!�\n\n\nBal.                        The song is English, and I oft have heard it\nIn merry England, never so plaintively,\nHist! hist! it comes again!\n\nVoice\n(more loudly).     �Is it so strong\nAs for to leave me thus,\nThat have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among?\nAnd is thy heart so strong\nAs for to leave me thus?\nSay nay! say nay!�\n\nBal.                        �Tis hushed and all is still!\n\nPol.                        All is not still.\n\nBal.                        Let us go down.\n\nPol.                        Go down, Baldazzar, go!\n\nBal.                        The hour is growing late, the Duke awaits us,,\nThy presence is expected in the hall\nBelow. What ails thee, Earl Politian?\n\nVoice\n(distinctly).     �Who have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among,\nAnd is thy heart so strong?\nSay nay! say nay!�\n\nBal.                        Let us descend!, �tis time. Politian, give\nThese fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,\nYour bearing lately savored much of rudeness\nUnto the Duke. Arouse thee! and remember!\n\nPol.                        Remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.\n(going).\nLet us descend. Believe me I would give,\nFreely would give the broad lands of my earldom\nTo look upon the face hidden by yon lattice,\n�To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear\nOnce more that silent tongue.�\n\nBal.                        Let me beg you, sir,\nDescend with me, the Duke may be offended.\nLet us go down, I pray you.\n\nVoice (loudly). Say nay!, say nay!\n\nPol. (aside). �Tis strange!, �tis very strange, methought\nthe voice\nChimed in with my desires and bade me stay!\n(Approaching the window)\nSweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.\nNow be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,\nStill will I not descend. Baldazzar, make\nApology unto the Duke for me;\nI go not down to-night.\n\nBal.                        Your lordship�s pleasure\nShall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.\n\nPol.                        Good-night, my friend, good-night.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe Gardens of a Palace, Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.\n\n\nLalage.                 And dost thou speak of love\nTo me, Politian?, dost thou speak of love\nTo Lalage?, ah woe, ah woe is me!\nThis mockery is most cruel, most cruel indeed!\n\nPolitian.             Weep not! oh, sob not thus!, thy bitter tears\nWill madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage,\nBe comforted! I know, I know it all,\nAnd still I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,\nAnd beautiful Lalage!, turn here thine eyes!\nThou askest me if I could speak of love,\nKnowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen\nThou askest me that, and thus I answer thee,\nThus on my bended knee I answer thee. (kneeling.)\nSweet Lalage, I love thee, love thee, love thee;\nThro� good and ill, thro� weal and woe, I love thee.\nNot mother, with her first-born on her knee,\nThrills with intenser love than I for thee.\nNot on God�s altar, in any time or clime,\nBurned there a holier fire than burneth now\nWithin my spirit for thee. And do I love?\n(arising.)\nEven for thy woes I love thee, even for thy woes,\nThy beauty and thy woes.\n\nLal.                        Alas, proud Earl,\nThou dost forget thyself, remembering me!\nHow, in thy father�s halls, among the maidens\nPure and reproachless of thy princely line,\nCould the dishonored Lalage abide?\nThy wife, and with a tainted memory,\nMy seared and blighted name, how would it tally\nWith the ancestral honors of thy house,\nAnd with thy glory?\n\nPol.                        Speak not to me of glory!\nI hate, I loathe the name; I do abhor\nThe unsatisfactory and ideal thing.\nArt thou not Lalage, and I Politian?\nDo I not love, art thou not beautiful,\nWhat need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:\nBy all I hold most sacred and most solemn,\nBy all my wishes now, my fears hereafter,\nBy all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven,\nThere is no deed I would more glory in,\nThan in thy cause to scoff at this same glory\nAnd trample it under foot. What matters it,\nWhat matters it, my fairest, and my best,\nThat we go down unhonored and forgotten\nInto the dust, so we descend together?\nDescend together, and then, and then perchance,\n\nLal.                        Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\nPol.                        And then perchance\nArise together, Lalage, and roam\nThe starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,\nAnd still,\n\nLal.                        Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\nPol.                        And still together, together.\n\nLal.                        Now, Earl of Leicester!\nThou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts\nI feel thou lovest me truly.\n\nPol.                        O Lalage!\n(throwing himself upon his knee.)\nAnd lovest thou me?\n\nLal.                        Hist! hush! within the gloom\nOf yonder trees methought a figure passed,\nA spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless,\nLike the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.\n(walks across and returns.)\nI was mistaken, �twas but a giant bough\nStirred by the autumn wind. Politian!\n\nPol.                        My Lalage, my love! why art thou moved?\nWhy dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,\nFar less a shadow which thou likenest to it,\nShould shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind\nIs chilly, and these melancholy boughs\nThrow over all things a gloom.\n\nLal.                        Politian!\nThou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land\nWith which all tongues are busy, a land new found,\nMiraculously found by one of Genoa,\nA thousand leagues within the golden west?\nA fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,,\nAnd crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,\nAnd mountains, around whose towering summits the winds\nOf Heaven untrammelled flow, which air to breathe\nIs Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter\nIn days that are to come?\n\nPol.                        Oh, wilt thou, wilt thou\nFly to that Paradise, my Lalage, wilt thou\nFly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,\nAnd Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.\nAnd life shall then be mine, for I will live\nFor thee, and in thine eyes, and thou shalt be\nNo more a mourner, but the radiant Joys\nShall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope\nAttend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee\nAnd worship thee, and call thee my beloved,\nMy own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,\nMy all;, oh, wilt thou, wilt thou, Lalage,\nFly thither with me?\n\nLal.                        A deed is to be done,\nCastiglione lives!\n\nPol.                        And he shall die!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nLal.\n(after a pause). And, he, shall, die!, alas!\nCastiglione die? Who spoke the words?\nWhere am I?, what was it he said?, Politian!\nThou art not gone, thou art not gone, Politian!\nI feel thou art not gone, yet dare not look,\nLest I behold thee not, thou couldst not go\nWith those words upon thy lips, oh, speak to me!\nAnd let me hear thy voice, one word, one word,\nTo say thou art not gone,, one little sentence,\nTo say how thou dost scorn, how thou dost hate\nMy womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou art not gone,\nOh, speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!\nI knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.\nVillain, thou art not gone, thou mockest me!\nAnd thus I clutch thee, thus!, He is gone, he is gone,\nGone, gone. Where am I?, �tis well, �tis very well!\nSo that the blade be keen, the blow be sure,\n�Tis well, �tis very well, alas! alas!\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nThe Suburbs.

Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,\nAnd I have not forgotten it, thou�lt do me\nA piece of service: wilt thou go back and say\nUnto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,\nHold him a villain?, thus much, I pr�ythee, say\nUnto the Count, it is exceeding just\nHe should have cause for quarrel.\n\nBal.                        My lord!, my friend!,\n\nPol.

I am aware\nOf nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,\nHaving given thee no offence.

Ha!\n\nCas.                        I dare not, dare not,\nHold off thy hand, with that beloved name\nSo fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee,\nI cannot, dare not.\n\nPol.                        Now, by my halidom,\nI do believe thee!, coward, I do believe thee!\n\nCas.                        Ha!, coward!, this may not be!\n(clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is\nchanged before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of\nthe Earl.)\nAlas! my lord,\nIt is, it is, most true. In such a cause\nI am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!\n\nPol.\n(greatly softened). Alas!, I do, indeed I pity thee.\n\nCas.                        And Lalage,\n\nPol.                        Scoundrel!, arise and die!\n\nCas.                        It needeth not be, thus, thus, Oh, let me die\nThus on my bended knee. It were most fitting\nThat in this deep humiliation I perish.\nFor in the fight I will not raise a hand\nAgainst thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home,\n(baring his bosom.)\nHere is no let or hindrance to thy weapon,\nStrike home. I will not fight thee.\n\nPol.                        Now�s Death and Hell!\nAm I not, am I not sorely, grievously tempted\nTo take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:\nThink not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare\nFor public insult in the streets, before\nThe eyes of the citizens. I�ll follow thee,\nLike an avenging spirit I�ll follow thee\nEven unto death.

Stay! Was it not\nOn yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\nOf the Earl Politian?

If I now recollect\nThe words you used were that the Earl you knew\nWas neither learned nor mirthful.\n\nCas.                        Ha! ha!, now did I?\n\nDuke.                     That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\nYou were wrong, it being not the character\nOf the Earl, whom all the world allows to be\nA most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\nToo positive again.\n\nCas.                        �Tis singular!\nMost singular! I could not think it possible\nSo little time could so much alter one!\nTo say the truth about an hour ago,\nAs I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\nAll arm in arm, we met this very man\nThe Earl, he, with his friend Baldazzar,\nHaving just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he is altered!\nSuch an account he gave me of his journey!\n�Twould have made you die with laughter, such tales he\ntold\nOf his caprices and his merry freaks\nAlong the road, such oddity, such humor,\nSuch wit, such whim, such flashes of wild merriment\nSet off too in such full relief by the grave\nDemeanor of his friend, who, to speak the truth\nWas gravity itself,\n\nDuke.                     Did I not tell you?\n\nCas.                        You did, and yet �tis strange! but true, as strange,\nHow much I was mistaken! I always thought\nThe Earl a gloomy man.\n\nDuke.                     So, so, you see!\nBe not too positive. Whom have we here?\nIt cannot be the Earl?\n\nCas.                        The Earl! Oh no!\nTis not the Earl, but yet it is, and leaning\nUpon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!\n(Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)\nMy lord, a second welcome let me give you\nTo Rome, his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\nFather! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\nOf Leicester in Great Britain.\n[Politian bows haughtily.]\nThat, his friend\nBaldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,\nSo please you, for Your Grace.\n\nDuke.                     Ha! ha! Most welcome\nTo Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!\nAnd you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!\nI knew your father well, my Lord Politian.\nCastiglione! call your cousin hither,\nAnd let me make the noble Earl acquainted\nWith your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time\nMost seasonable. The wedding,\n\nPolitian.             Touching those letters, sir,\nYour son made mention of, your son, is he not?,\nTouching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.\nIf such there be, my friend Baldazzar here,\nBaldazzar! ah!, my friend Baldazzar here\nWill hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.\n\nDuke.                     Retire!, so soon?\n\nCas.                        What ho! Benito! Rupert!\nHis lordship�s chambers, show his lordship to them!\nHis lordship is unwell.\n\n(Enter Benito.)\n\nBen.                        This way, my lord!\n\n(Exit, followed by Politian.)\n\nDuke.                     Retire! Unwell!\n\nBal.                        So please you, sir. I fear me\n�Tis as you say, his lordship is unwell.\nThe damp air of the evening, the fatigue\nOf a long journey, the, indeed I had better\nFollow his lordship. He must be unwell.\nI will return anon.\n\nDuke.                     Return anon!\nNow this is very strange! Castiglione!\nThis way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.\nYou surely were mistaken in what you said\nOf the Earl, mirthful, indeed!, which of us said\nPolitian was a melancholy man?\n\n(Exeunt.)",

    "text": "I will bring fire to thee.\n\nEuripides. �Androm�.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nWhy do you call me Eiros?\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nSo henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, my earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nThis is indeed no dream!\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nDreams are with us no more; but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational.\nThe film of the shadow has already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nTrue I feel no stupor none at all. The wild sickness and the terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad, rushing, horrible sound, like the �voice of many waters.� Yet my senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception of the new.\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nA few days will remove all this; but I fully understand you, and feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you undergo yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nIn Aidenn?\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nIn Aidenn.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nO God! pity me, Charmion! I am overburthened with the majesty of all things of the unknown now known of the speculative Future merged in the august and certain Present.\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nGrapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this. Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward but back. I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nMost fearfully, fearfully! this is indeed no dream.\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nDreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nMourned, Charmion? oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.\n\n�Charmion�.\n\nAnd that last hour speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing.\nWhen, coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day.\n\n�Eiros�.\n\nThe individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had been well established. They had been observed to pass among the satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known. That among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.\n\nThe elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color. Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations.\nThe learned now gave their intellect their soul to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought they panted for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. Truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored.\n\nThat material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the density of the comet�s nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold. It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet were now altogether unknown, as if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest.\n\nWhat minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.\n\nThere was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms. A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts. Its historical attributes had disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion. We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken, with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.\n\nYet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable thing.\n\nYet another day and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come over all men; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.\n\nIt had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate; the entire fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\n\nWhy need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope.\nWe gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us; even here in Aidenn I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God! then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of Him; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.",

    "text": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door,\nOnly this, and nothing more.\"\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\nEagerly I wished the morrow;, vainly I had sought to borrow\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,\n\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-\nThis it is, and nothing more.\"\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you\", here I opened wide the door;-\nDarkness there, and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\",\nMerely this, and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice:\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;,\n'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door,\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.\n\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore,\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nMuch I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\nEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door,\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\nWith such name as \"Nevermore.\"\n\nBut the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\nNothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,\nTill I scarcely more than muttered, \"other friends have flown before,\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"\nThen the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore,\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\nOf 'Never, nevermore'.\"\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\nThen upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\n\nMeant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\nOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,\nBut whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee, by these angels he hath sent thee\nRespite, respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"\nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!, prophet still, if bird or devil!,\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,\nOn this home by horror haunted, tell me truly, I implore,\nIs there, is there balm in Gilead?, tell me, tell me, I implore!\"\nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil, prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore,\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"\nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\n\"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,\" I shrieked, upstarting,\n\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!, quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my\ndoor!\"\nQuoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,\nAnd the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\nShall be lifted, nevermore!",

Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition.\nFor wisdom, ask of the angels freely, that it may be given!\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nBut in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nAh, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know all, were the curse of a fiend.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nBut does not The Most High know all?\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nThat (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the one thing unknown even to Him.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nBut, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things be known?\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nLook down into the abysmal distances!, attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them thus, and thus, and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?, the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity?\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nI clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nThere are no dreams in Aidenn, but it is here whispered that, of this infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever unquenchable within it, since to quench it would be to extinguish the soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear. Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion, where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the triplicate and triple-tinted suns.\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nAnd now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!, speak to me in the earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is not God?\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nI mean to say that the Deity does not create.\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nExplain!\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nIn the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or immediate results of the Divine creative power.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nAmong men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the extreme.\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nAmong the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nI can comprehend you thus far, that certain operations of what we term Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation. Shortly before the final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to denominate the creation of animalculae.\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nThe cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the first law.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nAre not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst hourly forth into the heavens, are not these stars, Agathos, the immediate handiwork of the King?\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nLet me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth's air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation, so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless, and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of algebraic analysis, who saw, too, the facility of the retrogradation, these men saw, at the same time, that this species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress, that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.\n\n'Oinos.'\n\nAnd why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?\n\n'Agathos.'\n\nBecause there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite understanding, one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis lay unfolded, there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air, and the ether through the air, to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the end impress every individual thing that exists within the universe;, and the being of infinite understanding, the being whom we have imagined, might trace the remote undulations of the impulse, trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of all matter, upward and onward forever in their modifications of old forms, or, in other words, in their creation of new, until he found them reflected, unimpressive at last, back from the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this, but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him, should one of these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his inspection, he could have no difficulty in determining, by the analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection, this faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all causes, is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone, but in every variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nBut you speak merely of impulses upon the air.\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nIn speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether, which, since it pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of creation.\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nThen all motion, of whatever nature, creates?\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nIt must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought, and the source of all thought is,\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nGod.\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nI have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which lately perished, of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nYou did.\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nAnd while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words? Is not every word an impulse on the air?\n\n'Oinos'.\n\nBut why, Agathos, do you weep, and why, oh, why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair star, which is the greenest and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant flowers look like a fairy dream, but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart.\n\n'Agathos'.\n\nThey are!, they are!, This wild star, it is now three centuries since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my beloved, I spoke it, with a few passionate sentences, into birth. Its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and unhallowed of hearts!",

    "text": "It is with humility really unassumed, it is with a sentiment even of awe, that I pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable subjects I approach the reader with the most solemn, the most comprehensive, the most difficult, the most august.\n\nWhat terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their sublimity � sufficiently sublime in their simplicity, for the mere enunciation of my theme?\n\nI design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical � of the Material and Spiritual Universe:�of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny. I shall be so rash, moreover, as to chAllange the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men.\n\nIn the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce, not the theorem which I hope to demonstrate, for, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, no such thing as demonstration, but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, I shall be continually endeavoring to suggest.\n\nMy general proposition, then, is this:, In the Original Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation.\n\nIn illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey of the Universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression.\n\nHe who from the top of AEtna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene. Only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its oneness. But as, on the summit of AEtna, no man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind.\n\nI do not know a treatise in which a survey of the Universe � using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation, is taken at all:, and it may be as well here to mention that by the term \"Universe,\" wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can he imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse. In speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, \"Universe,\" I shall take a phrase of limitation, \"the Universe of stars.\" Why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel.\n\nBut even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the un limited, Universe of stars, I know none in which a survey, even of this limited Universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality. The nearest approach to such a work is made in the \"Cosmos\" of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject, however, not in its individuality but in its generality. His theme, in its last result, is the law of each portion of the merely physical Universe, as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical Universe. His design is simply synoeretical. In a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality. But however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which preclude all individuality of impression.\n\nIt seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences, the conclusions, the suggestions, the speculations, or, if nothing better offer itself, the mere guesses which may result from it, we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiae vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one. Among the vanishing minutiae, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of Intelligences.\n\nAnd now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader's attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the Mare Tenebrarum�an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer, Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets. The date of this letter, I confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year Two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about to transcribe, they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.\n\n\"Do you know, my dear friend,\" says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary, \"Do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to Truth? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher called Aries and surnamed Tottle.\" [Here, possibly, the letter-writer means Aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years.] \"The fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the de ductive or a priori philosophy. He started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths:, and the now well-understood fact that no truths are self -evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations:, it was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. From axioms he proceeded, logically, to results. His most illustrious disciples were one Tuclid, a geometrician,\" [meaning Euclid] \"and one Kant, a Dutchman, the originator of that species of Transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears his peculiar name.\n\n\"Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one Hog, surnamed 'the Ettrick shepherd,' who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or in ductive. His plan referred altogether to sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts, instantiae Naturae, as they were somewhat affectedly called, and arranging them into general laws. In a word, while the mode of Aries rested on noumena, that of Hog depended on phenomena; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, Aries fell into general disrepute. Finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of Philosophy with his more modern rival:, the savans contenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a Median law, to the effect that the Aristotelian and Baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the sole possible avenues to knowledge:, 'Baconian,' you must know, my dear friend,\" adds the letter-writer at this point, \"was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious.\n\n\"Now I do assure you most positively\", proceeds the epistle, \"that I represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most important advances, as all History will show, by seemingly intuitive leaps. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind;, but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? For many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever:, 'the means!' they vociferated, 'let us look at the means!' � and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram), why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a 'theorist,' would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with him or with his truths.\n\n\"Now, my dear friend,\" continues the letter-writer, \"it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty was very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes. They blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch snuff of detail; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were by no means always facts, a point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were. The vital taint, however, in Baconianism, its most lamentable fount of error, lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men, of those inter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans, the diggers and pedlers of minute facts, for the most part in physical science � facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the fact of their fact, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.\n\n\"Than the persons\", the letter goes on to say, \"than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted, thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of Science, from its pantries into its pulpits, than these individuals a more intolerant, a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth. Their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word 'fact', but, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning. On those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts at generalization were met at once by the words 'theoretical,' 'theory,' 'theorist', all thought, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these Bacon-engendered philosophers, one-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg, were more wretchedly helpless, more miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing.\n\n\"Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the a priori path of axioms, or of the Ram. At innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram's-horn. The simple truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all. This they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted 'axioms' had been abandoned:, 'ex nihilo nihil fit,' for example, and a 'thing cannot act where it is not,' and 'there cannot be antipodes,' and 'darkness cannot proceed from light.' These and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be altogether untenable:, how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest!\n\n\"But, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these a priori reasoners of the grossest unreason, it is easy to show the futility, the impalpability of their axioms in general. I have now lying before me\" � it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter, \"I have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is 'Logic.' The author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one Miller or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham:, but let us glance at the volume itself!\n\n\"Ah!, 'Ability or inability to conceive,' says Mr. Mill very properly, 'is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.' Now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. Not to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to David Hume would very seldom be a truth to Joe; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in Heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth. The proposition of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to be an axiom; and this merely because I am showing that no axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to grant that, if an axiom there be, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom, that no more absolute axiom is, and, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself, that is to say no axiom, or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor.\n\n\"And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded. Let us give Mr. Mill the fairest of play. We will bring the point to no ordinary issue. We will select for investigation no common-place axiom, no axiom of what, not the less preposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class, as if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth:, we will select, I say, no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in Euclid. We will not talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts. We will afford the logician every advantage. We will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionable, as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. Here it is:, 'Contradictions cannot both be true � that is, cannot coexist in nature.' Here Mr. Mill means, for instance,, and I give the most forcible instance conceivable, that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree, that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree:, all which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages before, in other words, words which I have previously employed, until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. 'A tree,' Mr. Mill asserts, 'must be either a tree or not a tree.' Very well:, and now let me ask him, why. To this little query there is but one response:, I defy any man living to invent a second. The sole answer is this: � 'Because we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be anything else than a tree or not a tree.' This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill's sole answer:, he will not pretend to suggest another:, and yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not already required us to admit, as an axiom, that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? Thus all, absolutely his argumentation is at sea without a rudder. Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made, in cases where the 'impossibility to conceive' is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree. Let no attempt, I say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first place, there are no degrees of 'impossibility,' and thus no one impossible conception can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible conception:, in the second place, Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that, in no case, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth:, in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here. That a tree can be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the devils, may entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly Bedlamite, or Transcendentalist, does.\n\n\"Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,\" continues the letter-writer, \"so much on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic, which, to be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether, as on account of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all other roads to Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths, the one of creeping and the other of crawling, to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have dared to confine the Soul, the Soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant of 'path.'\n\n\"By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by their Hogs and Rams, that in spite of the eternal prating of their savans about roads to Truth, none of them fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere roads, the great thoroughfare, the majestic highway of the Consistent? Is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vitally momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth? How plain, how rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition! By its means, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles, and given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true, to the only true thinkers, to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These latter, our Keplers, our Laplaces, 'speculate', 'theorize', these are the terms � can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate, theorize � and their theories are merely corrected, reduced, sifted, cleared, little by little, of their chaff of inconsistency, until at length there stands apparent an unencumbered Consistency, a consistency which the most stolid admit, because it is a consistency, to be an absolute and unquestionable TRuth.\n\n\"I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of their two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicated cyphers, or by which of them Champollion guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so many centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of Egypt. In especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of their truths, the truth, the fact of gravitation? Newton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted that these laws he guessed, these laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of British astronomers that principle, the basis of all (existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of Metaphysics. Yes!, these vital laws Kepler guessed, that it is to say, he imagined them. Had he been asked to point out either the de ductive or in ductive route by which he attained them, his reply might have been, 'I know nothing about routes, but I do know the machinery of the Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with my soul, I reached it through mere dint of intuition.' Alas, poor ignorant old man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called 'intuition' was but the conviction resulting from de ductions or in ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression? How great a pity it is that some 'moral philosopher' had not enlightened him about all this! How it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and legitimately, that is to say Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly, into the vast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by mortal hand, unseen by mortal eye, the imperishable and priceless secrets of the Universe!\n\n\"Yes, Kepler was essentially a theorist; but this title, now of so much sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme contempt. It is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old man, to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his ever-memorable words. For my part,\" continues the unknown correspondent, \"I glow with a sacred fire when I even think of them, and feel that I shall never grow weary of their repetition: � in concluding this letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once again:, 'I care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can afford to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited six thousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have stolen the golden secret of the Egyptians. I will indulge my sacred fury.'\"\n\nHere end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps, somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment, in any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies of the writer, whoever he is, fancies so radically at war with the well-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us proceed, then, to our legitimate thesis, The Universe.\n\nThis thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion:, We may as cend or des cend. Beginning at our own point of view, at the Earth on which we stand, we may pass to the other planets of our system, thence to the Sun, thence to our system considered collectively, and thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of Man. Usually, that is to say, in ordinary essays on Astronomy, the first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted:, this for the obvious reason that astronomical facts, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my present purpose, however,, that of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distant conception of the individual Universe, it is clear that a descent to small from great, to the outskirts from the centre (if we could establish a centre), to the end from the beginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in quantity, that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance.\n\nNow, distinctness, intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design. On important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure. But abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject per se. All are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps. It is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the Differential Calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon Seesaw.\n\nBy way of admitting, then, no chance for misapprehension, I think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of Astronomy were unknown to the reader. In combining the two modes of discussion to which I have referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each, and very especially of the iteration in detail which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan. Commencing with a descent, I shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made.\n\nLet us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, \"Infinity.\" This, like \"God,\" \"spirit,\" and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea, but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this effort, the cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the object of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect. Out of this demand arose the word, \"Infinity;\" which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought.\n\nAs regards that infinity now considered, the infinity of space, we often hear it said that \"its idea is admitted by the mind, is acquiesced in, is entertained, on account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit.\" But this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves. The quibble lies concealed in the word \"difficulty.\" \"The mind,\" we are told, \"entertains the idea of limitless, through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited, space.\" Now, were the proposition but fairly put, its absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly, there is no mere difficulty in the case. The assertion intended, if presented according to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus:, \"The mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited, space.\"\n\nIt must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities, or of two arguments between whose respective validities, the reason is called upon to decide:, it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other. The choice is not made between two difficulties;, it is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities. Now of the former, there are degrees,, but of the latter, none:, just as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested. A task may be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible:, there are no gradations. It might be more difficult to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other. A man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty, but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star.\n\nSince all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of conception: since one impossibility cannot be greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man's idea of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, infinity itself, are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing, is impossible too. This, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is:, indeed I think it very capital nonsense, but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine.\n\nThe readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked, the fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition. \"The mind is impelled,\" say the theologians and others, \"to admit a First Cause, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end.\" The quibble, as before, lies in the word \"difficulty\", but here what is it employed to sustain? A First Cause. And what is a First Cause? An ultimate termination of causes. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity, the Finite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God knows how many philosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity, could it not be brought to support something besides? As for the quibblers, they, at least, are insupportable. But, to dismiss them:, what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other.\n\nOf course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word \"Infinity.\" My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove Infinity itself, or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed.\n\nNevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that I cannot conceive Infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. A mind not thoroughly self-conscious, not accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations, will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak. In the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step, we fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we Continue the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor, of fulfilling (as we think) the idea, of putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception, that we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking., In attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a limited space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility.\n\nWe believe in a God. We may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as faith, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper, from that intellectual belief, which presupposes the mental conception.\n\nThe fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which \"Infinity\" belongs, the class representing thoughts of thought, he who has a right to say that he thinks at all, feels himself called upon, not to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the inessentiality, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not designed it to be solved. He sees, at once, that it lies out of the brain of man, and even how, if not exactly why, it lies out of it. There are people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension.\n\nIt will now be understood that, in using the phrase, \"Infinity of Space,\" I make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an absolute infinity. I refer simply to the \"utmost conceivable expanse\" of space, a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination.\n\nHitherto, the Universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the commencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or indirectly assumed, at least since the dawn of intelligible Astronomy, that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word \"Universe.\" \"It is a sphere,\" he says, \"of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere.\" But although this intended definition is, in fact, no definition of the Universe of stars, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the Universe proper, that is to say, of the Universe of space. This latter, then, let us regard as \"a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.\" In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings.\n\nAs our starting point, then, let us adopt the Godhead. Of this Godhead, in itself, he alone is not imbecile, he alone is not impious who propounds, nothing. \"Nous ne connaissons rien,\" says the Baron de Bielfeld, \"Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l'essence de Dieu:, pour savoir ce qu'il est, il faut etre Dieu meme.\", \"We know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of God: � in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.\"\n\n\"We should have to be God ourselves!\", With a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is everlastingly condemned.\n\nBy Him, however, now, at least, the Incomprehensible, by Him � assuming him as Spirit, that is to say, as not Matter, a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition, by Him, then, existing as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been created, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his Volition, at some point of Space which we will take as a centre, at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote, by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been created, what? This is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations. What is it that we are justified, that alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, created?\n\nWe have attained a point where only Intuition can aid us:, but now let me recur to the idea which I have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition. It is but the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression. With this understanding, I now assert, that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what God originally created, that that Matter which, by dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from Nihility, Could have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable state of � what?, of Simplicity?\n\nThis will be found the sole absolute assumption of my Discourse. I use the word \"assumption\" in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly, no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly, more rigorously de duced:, but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis, at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue.\n\nLet us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of Simplicity. Here the Reason flies at once to Imparticularity, to a particle, to one particle, a particle of one kind, of one character, of one nature, of one size, of one form � a particle, therefore, \"without form and void\", a particle positively a particle at all points, a particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because He who created it, by dint of his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same Will, as a matter of course, divide it.\n\nOneness, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created Matter; but I propose to show that this Oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phaenomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material Universe.\n\nThe willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the Conception, of Creation. We now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created � that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see it, the constitution of the Universe from it, the Particle.\n\nThis constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally One into the abnormal condition of Many. An action of this character implies reaction. A diffusion from Unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into Unity, a tendency ineradicable until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more fully hereafter.\n\nThe assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes that of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the Particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one Particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically, in all directions, to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space, a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms.\n\nNow, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted, not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? Unity being their source, and difference from Unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself:, that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More explicitly, are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size?, and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? In such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which I have suggested, the design of variety out of unity, diversity out of sameness � heterogeneity out of homogeneity, complexity out of simplicity, in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative One. Undoubtedly, therefore, we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable. Difference of size, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form, a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. Difference of kind, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly:, in fact, since the Unity of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine Will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature:, so fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. We perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it, all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution:, We thus establish the Universe on a purely geometrical basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among the atoms irradiated, any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. We are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar form, no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable reunition at the end.\n\nAlthough the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms to return into their normal Unity, is implied, as I have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence, a tendency and no more, until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave it, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a reaction, in other words, a satisfiable tendency of the disunited atoms to return into One.\n\nBut the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the reaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design, that of the utmost possible Relation, this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general. Multiplicity is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing at once, through the now satisfiable tendency, before the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity, into absolute oneness among themselves:, there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses, at various points of space: � in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely One.\n\nFor the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity, a separate something which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power, up to a certain epoch, of preventing their Coalition, but no ability to interfere with their Coalescence in any respect or degree. The repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, only up to a certain epoch. Unless we are to conceive that the appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never;, unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end, a conception which cannot really be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it � we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally, under pressure of the Uni-tendency collectively applied, but, never and in no degree until, on fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made, yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, One., The conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed:, we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation;, nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive.\n\nThat the repulsive something actually exists, we see. Man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact. This is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter. All Experiment proves, all Philosophy admits it. The design of the repulsion, the necessity for its existence, I have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual, lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding � lies involved in a consideration of what now, in our human state, is not to be considered, in a consideration of Spirit in itself. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the God.\n\nIn fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the Newtonian Gravity, what I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as that which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as electricity; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it.\n\nCalling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, heterogeneity. Only where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached unempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained to be that of preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. Difference is their character, their essentiality, just as no-difference was the essentiality of their course. When we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity. All existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each:, an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this:, The amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed. That no two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing always, is developed whenever any bodies, but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation.\n\nTo electricity, so, for the present, continuing to call it, we may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phaenomena of vitality, consciousness and Thought. On this topic, however, I need pause here merely to suggest that these phaenomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous.\n\nDiscarding now the two equivocal terms, \"gravitation\" and \"electricity,\" let us adopt the more definite expressions, \"attraction\" and \"repulsion.\" The former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. No other principles exist. All phaenomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case, so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the Universe, in other words, by which Matter is manifested to Mind, that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsion, that attraction and repulsion are matter:, there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term \"matter\" and the terms \"attraction\" and \"repulsion,\" taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in Logic.\n\nI said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the Newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there can be but little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the Newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known modus operandi of the Newtonian force. The general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears in coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions, a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. Here, then, is an in coincidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical LA0 governing the Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the modus operandi, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which I have assumed.\n\nIn fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes. So far, we have gone on a priori, from an abstract consideration of Simplicity, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of God. Let us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian Gravitation may not afford us, a posteriori, some legitimate inductions.\n\nWhat does the Newtonian law declare?, That all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology:, Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom., Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.\n\nBut let us see distinctly what it was that Newton proved � according to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing Universe so far as it comes under our observation. This was the amount of his demonstration, that is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the \"philosophies.\" His successes added proof multiplied by proof, such proof as a sound intellect admits, but the demonstration of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree. \"Ocular, physical proof,\" however, of attraction, here upon Earth, in accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In the famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the British astronomer.\n\nBut in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none, in spite of the so-called corroboration of the \"theory\" by the so-called \"ocular and physical proof\", in spite of the character of this corroboration, the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity, and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are seen to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed, merely in the planet upon which they stand.\n\nNow, to what does so partial a consideration tend, to what species of error does it give rise? On the Earth we see and feel, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the Earth. No man in the common walks of life could be made to see or feel anything else, could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the Earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not only to the Earth's centre but in every conceivable direction besides.\n\nNow, although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the sentiment of the vulgar idea. \"Although the Pagan fables are not believed,\" says Bryant, in his very erudite \"Mythology,\" \"yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities.\" I mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on Earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of Concentralization or especiality respecting it, has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects, perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction, behind the principle's essential characteristics, those, not of concentralization or especiality, but of universality and diffusion. This \"vital truth\" is Unity as the source of the phaenomenon.\n\nLet me now repeat the definition of gravity:, Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom.\n\nHere let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous, of the ineffable, of the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom, involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested, involved merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe.\n\nHad we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point, to some especially attractive atom, we should still have fAllan upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind:, but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? That each atom attracts, sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. If I venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have done a deed which shakes the Moon in her path, which causes the Sun to be no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their Creator.\n\nThese ideas, conceptions such as these, unthought-like thoughts � soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect:, ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, Attraction.\n\nBut now,, with such ideas, with such a vision of the marvellous complexity of Attraction fairly in his mind, let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phaenomena observed, a condition from which they sprang.\n\nDoes not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? It is not that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations, but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex:, it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even more than together, is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were One, that now, in all circumstances, at all points, in all directions, by all modes of approach, in all relations and through all conditions, they struggle back to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally one?\n\nSome person may here demand:, \"Why, since it is to the One that the atoms struggle back, do we not find and define Attraction 'a merely general tendency to a centre?', why, in especial, do not your atoms, the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre, proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?\"\n\nI reply that they do; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such. They all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled, but is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin. It is not to any point that the atoms are allied. It is not any locality, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like location was conceived as their origin. Their source lies in the principle, Unity. This is their lost parent. This they seek always, immediately, in all directions, wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the LA0 or modus operandi, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular: � that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each:, for the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such., Thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what I propose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more ample phraseology adopted:, for instance: � \"Each atom tends to every other atom &c. with a force &c.: the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre.\"\n\nThe reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process intuition was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former journey I could only say that, with an irresistable intuition, I felt Simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of God:, in ending the latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed phaenomena of the Newtonian gravitation. Thus, according to the schools, I prove nothing. So be it:, I design but to suggest-and to Convince through the suggestion. I am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously discriminative human intellects which cannot help being abundantly content with my, suggestions. To these intellects, as to my own, there is no mathematical demonstration which Could bring the least additional TRue proof of the great TRuth which I have advanced � the truth of Original Unity as the source, as the principle of the Universal Phaenomena. For my part, I am not sure that I speak and see, I am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives: � of the rising of to-morrow's sun, a probability that as yet lies in the Future, I do not pretend to be one thousandth part as sure, as I am of the irretrievably by-gone Fact that All Things and All Thoughts of Things, with all their ineffable Multiplicity of Relation, sprang at once into being from the primordial and irrel",

    "text": "In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be either thorough or profound. While discussing, very much at random, the essentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration, some few of those minor English or American poems which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the most definite impression. By \"minor poems\" I mean, of course, poems of little length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that the phrase, \"a long poem,\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.\n\nI need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychal necessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at the very utmost, it flags fails a revulsion ensues and then the poem is, in effect, and in fact, no longer such.\n\nThere are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the \"Paradise Lost\" is to be devoutly admired throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it, during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical, only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art, Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve its Unity its totality of effect or impression we read it (as would be necessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be true poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing the work, we read it again, omitting the first book that is to say, commencing with the second we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned that damnable which we had previously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate, aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a nullity: and this is precisely the fact.\n\nIn regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but, granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of art. The modem epic is, of the supposititious ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the day of these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem were popular in reality, which I doubt, it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again.\n\nThat the extent of a poetical work is, ceteris paribus, the measure of its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition sufficiently absurd yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly Reviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly considered there can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of the sublime but no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even \"The Columbiad.\" Even the Quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it. As yet, they have not insisted on our estimating Lamar\" tine by the cubic foot, or Pollock by the pound but what else are we to infer from their continual plating about \"sustained effort\"? If, by \"sustained effort,\" any little gentleman has accomplished an epic, I frankly commend him for the effort if this indeed be a thing conk mendable but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped that common sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Art rather by the impression it makes by the effect it produces than by the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of \"sustained effort\" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. The fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another nor can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, this proposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be received as self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned as falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief. Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A very short poem, while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a profound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax. De Beranger has wrought innumerable things, pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind.\n\nA remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the following exquisite little Serenade\n\nI arise from dreams of thee\nIn the first sweet sleep of night,\nWhen the winds are breathing low,\nAnd the stars are shining bright.\nI arise from dreams of thee,\nAnd a spirit in my feet\nHas led me who knows how?\nTo thy chamber-window, sweet!\n\nThe wandering airs they faint\nOn the dark the silent stream\nThe champak odors fail\nLike sweet thoughts in a dream;\nThe nightingale's complaint,\nIt dies upon her heart,\nAs I must die on shine,\nO, beloved as thou art!\n\nO, lift me from the grass!\nI die, I faint, I fail!\nLet thy love in kisses rain\nOn my lips and eyelids pale.\nMy cheek is cold and white, alas!\nMy heart beats loud and fast:\nO, press it close to shine again,\nWhere it will break at last.\n\nVery few perhaps are familiar with these lines yet no less a poet than Shelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.\n\nOne of the finest poems by Willis the very best in my opinion which he has ever written has no doubt, through this same defect of undue brevity, been kept back from its proper position. not less in the\n\nThe shadows lay along Broadway,\n'Twas near the twilight-tide\nAnd slowly there a lady fair\nWas walking in her pride.\nAlone walk'd she; but, viewlessly,\nWalk'd spirits at her side.\n\nPeace charm'd the street beneath her feet,\nAnd Honor charm'd the air;\nAnd all astir looked kind on her,\nAnd called her good as fair\nFor all God ever gave to her\nShe kept with chary care.\n\nShe kept with care her beauties rare\nFrom lovers warm and true\nFor heart was cold to all but gold,\nAnd the rich came not to won,\nBut honor'd well her charms to sell.\nIf priests the selling do.\n\nNow walking there was one more fair\nA slight girl, lily-pale;\nAnd she had unseen company\nTo make the spirit quail\n'Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,\nAnd nothing could avail.\n\nNo mercy now can clear her brow\nFrom this world's peace to pray\nFor as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,\nHer woman's heart gave way!\nBut the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven\nBy man is cursed alway!\n\nIn this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has written so many mere \"verses of society.\" The lines are not only richly ideal, but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author.\n\nWhile the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of The Didactic. It has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that the ultimate object of all Poetry is Truth. Every poem, it is said, should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force: but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written solely for the poem's sake.\n\nWith as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man, I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. I would limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation. The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles. All that which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must be simple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word, we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact converse of the poetical. He must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemption who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.\n\nDividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. I place Taste in the middle, because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; but from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concerns itself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the Moral Sense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches the obligation, and\nReason the expediency, Taste contents herself with displaying the charms: waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her deformity her disproportion her animosity to the fitting, to the appropriate, to the harmonious in a word, to Beauty.\n\nAn immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors and sentiments amid which he exists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of Amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a duplicate source of de\" light. But this mere repetition is not poetry. He who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind he, I say, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through' the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.\n\nThe struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness this struggle, on the part of souls fittingly constituted has given to the world all that which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic.\n\nThe Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes in Painting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance very especially in Music and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the com position of the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only to its manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in its various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected is so vitally important an adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment, it struggles the creation of supernal Beauty. It may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and then, attained in fact. We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight, that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess and Thomas Moore, singing his own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.\n\nTo recapitulate then: I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty. Its sole arbiter is Taste. With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations. Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with Truth.\n\nA few words, however, in explanation. That pleasure which is at once the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, I maintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplation of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the Poetic Sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is the satisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement of the heart. I make Beauty, therefore using the word as inclusive of the sublime I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes: no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of Passion' or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons of Truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.\n\nI cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your consideration, than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow's \"Waif\":\n\n\nThe day is done, and the darkness\nFalls from the wings of Night,\nAs a feather is wafted downward\nFrom an Eagle in his flight.\n\nI see the lights of the village\nGleam through the rain and the mist,\nAnd a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,\nThat my soul cannot resist;\n\nA feeling of sadness and longing,\nThat is not akin to pain,\nAnd resembles sorrow only\nAs the mist resembles the rain.\n\nCome, read to me some poem,\nSome simple and heartfelt lay,\nThat shall soothe this restless feeling,\nAnd banish the thoughts of day.\n\nNot from the grand old masters,\nNot from the bards sublime,\nWhose distant footsteps echo\nThrough the corridors of Time.\n\nFor, like strains of martial music,\nTheir mighty thoughts suggest\nLife's endless toil and endeavor;\nAnd to-night I long for rest.\n\nRead from some humbler poet,\nWhose songs gushed from his heart,\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\nOr tears from the eyelids start;\n\nWho through long days of labor,\nAnd nights devoid of ease,\nStill heard in his soul the music\nOf wonderful melodies.\n\nSuch songs have power to quiet\nThe restless pulse of care,\nAnd come like the benediction\nThat follows after prayer.\n\nThen read from the treasured volume\nThe poem of thy choice,\nAnd lend to the rhyme of the poet\nThe beauty of thy voice.\n\nAnd the night shall be filled with music,\nAnd the cares that infest the day\nShall fold their tents like the Arabs,\nAnd as silently steal away.\n\nWith no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly\nadmired for their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very\neffective. Nothing can be better than\n\n- the bards sublime,\nWhose distant footsteps echo\nDown the corridors of Time.\n\nThe idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on the whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner. This \"ease\" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone as a point of really difficult attainment. But not so: a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it to the unnatural. It is but the result of writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone, in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. The author who, after the fashion of \"The North American Review,\" should be upon all occasions merely \"quiet,\" must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to be considered \"easy\" or \"natural\" than a Cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping Beauty in the waxworks.\n\nAmong the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles \"June.\" I quote only a portion of it:\n\nThere, through the long, long summer hours,\nThe golden light should lie,\nAnd thick young herbs and groups of flowers\nStand in their beauty by.\nThe oriole should build and tell\nHis love-tale, close beside my cell;\nThe idle butterfly\nShould rest him there, and there be heard\nThe housewife-bee and humming bird.\n\nAnd what, if cheerful shouts at noon,\nCome, from the village sent,\nOr songs of maids, beneath the moon,\nWith fairy laughter blent?\nAnd what if, in the evening light,\nBetrothed lovers walk in sight\nOf my low monument?\nI would the lovely scene around\nMight know no sadder sight nor sound.\n\nI know, I know I should not see\nThe season's glorious show,\nNor would its brightness shine for me;\nNor its wild music flow;\nBut if, around my place of sleep,\nThe friends I love should come to weep,\nThey might not haste to go.\nSoft airs and song, and the light and bloom,\nShould keep them lingering by my tomb.\n\nThese to their soften'd hearts should bear\nThe thoughts of what has been,\nAnd speak of one who cannot share\nThe gladness of the scene;\nWhose part in all the pomp that fills\nThe circuit of the summer hills,\nIs that his grave is green;\nAnd deeply would their hearts rejoice\nTo hear again his living voice.\n\nThe rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous nothing could be more melodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. The intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of all the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to the soul while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in the remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how or why we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,\n\nA feeling of sadness and longing\nThat is not akin to pain,\nAnd resembles sorrow only\nAs the mist resembles the rain.\n\nThe taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as \"The Health\" of Edward Coate Pinckney:\n\nI fill this cup to one made up\nOf loveliness alone,\nA woman, of her gentle sex\nThe seeming paragon;\nTo whom the better elements\nAnd kindly stars have given\nA form so fair that, like the air,\n'Tis less of earth than heaven.\n\nHer every tone is music's own,\nLike those of morning birds,\nAnd something more than melody\nDwells ever in her words;\nThe coinage of her heart are they,\nAnd from her lips each flows\nAs one may see the burden'd bee\nForth issue from the rose.\n\nAffections are as thoughts to her,\nThe measures of her hours;\nHer feelings have the flagrancy,\nThe freshness of young flowers;\nAnd lovely passions, changing oft,\nSo fill her, she appears\nThe image of themselves by turns,\nThe idol of past years!\n\nOf her bright face one glance will trace\nA picture on the brain,\nAnd of her voice in echoing hearts\nA sound must long remain;\nBut memory, such as mine of her,\nSo very much endears,\nWhen death is nigh my latest sigh\nWill not be life's, but hers.\n\nI fill'd this cup to one made up\nOf loveliness alone,\nA woman, of her gentle sex\nThe seeming paragon\nHer health! and would on earth there stood,\nSome more of such a frame,\nThat life might be all poetry,\nAnd weariness a name.\n\nIt was the misfortune of Mr. Pinckney to have been born too far south. Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conducting the thing called \"The North American Review.\" The poem just cited is especially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.\n\nIt was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves. Boccalini, in his \"Advertisements from Parnassus,\" tells us that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book: whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. He replied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this, Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward.\n\nNow this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics but I am by no means sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood. Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an axiom, which need only be properly put, to become self-evident. It is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such: and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit that they are not merits altogether.\n\nAmong the \"Melodies\" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view. I allude to his lines beginning \"Come, rest in this bosom.\" The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine passion of Love a sentiment which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate, human hearts than any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:\n\nCome, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer\nThough the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;\nHere still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,\nAnd a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.\n\nOh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same\nThrough joy and through torment, through glory and shame?\nI know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,\nI but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.\n\nThou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,\nAnd thy Angel I'll be, 'mid the horrors of this,\nThrough the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,\nAnd shield thee, and save thee,or perish there too!\n\nIt has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, while granting him Fancy a distinction originating with Coleridge than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is, that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only. But never was there a greater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet. In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more pro. foundry more weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than the lines commencing \"I would I were by that dim lake\" which are the com. position of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.\n\nOne of the noblest and, speaking of Fancy one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His \"Fair Ines\" had always for me an inexpressible charm:\n\nO saw ye not fair Ines?\nShe's gone into the West,\nTo dazzle when the sun is down,\nAnd rob the world of rest;\nShe took our daylight with her,\nThe smiles that we love best,\nWith morning blushes on her cheek,\nAnd pearls upon her breast.\n\nO turn again, fair Ines,\nBefore the fall of night,\nFor fear the moon should shine alone,\nAnd stars unrivalltd bright;\nAnd blessed will the lover be\nThat walks beneath their light,\nAnd breathes the love against thy cheek\nI dare not even write!\n\nWould I had been, fair Ines,\nThat gallant cavalier,\nWho rode so gaily by thy side,\nAnd whisper'd thee so near!\nWere there no bonny dames at home\nOr no true lovers here,\nThat he should cross the seas to win\nThe dearest of the dear?\n\nI saw thee, lovely Ines,\nDescend along the shore,\nWith bands of noble gentlemen,\nAnd banners waved before;\nAnd gentle youth and maidens gay,\nAnd snowy plumes they wore;\nIt would have been a beauteous dream,\nIf it had been no more!\n\nAlas, alas, fair Ines,\nShe went away with song,\nWith music waiting on her steps,\nAnd shootings of the throng;\nBut some were sad and felt no mirth,\nBut only Music's wrong,\nIn sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,\nTo her you've loved so long.\n\nFarewell, farewell, fair Ines,\nThat vessel never bore\nSo fair a lady on its deck,\nNor danced so light before,\nAlas for pleasure on the sea,\nAnd sorrow on the shorel\nThe smile that blest one lover's heart\nHas broken many more!\n\n\"The Haunted House,\" by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever written, one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is, moreover, powerfully ideal imaginative. I regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated \"Bridge of Sighs\":\n\nOne more Unfortunate,\nWeary of breath,\nRashly importunate\nGone to her death!\n\nTake her up tenderly,\nLift her with care;\nFashion'd so slenderly,\nYoung and so fair!\n\nLook at her garments\nClinging like cerements;\nWhilst the wave constantly\nDrips from her clothing;\nTake her up instantly,\nLoving not loathing.\n\nTouch her not scornfully;\nThink of her mournfully,\nGently and humanly;\nNot of the stains of her,\nAll that remains of her\nNow is pure womanly.\n\nMake no deep scrutiny\nInto her mutiny\nRash and undutiful;\nPast all dishonor,\nDeath has left on her\nOnly the beautiful.\n\nWhere the lamps quiver\nSo far in the river,\nWith many a light\nFrom window and casement\nFrom garret to basement,\nShe stood, with amazement,\nHouseless by night.\n\nThe bleak wind of March\nMade her tremble and shiver,\nBut not the dark arch,\nOr the black flowing river:\nMad from life's history,\nGlad to death's mystery,\nSwift to be hurl'd\nAnywhere, anywhere\nOut of the world!\n\nIn she plunged boldly,\nNo matter how coldly\nThe rough river ran,\nOver the brink of it,\nPicture it, think of it,\nDissolute Man!\nLave in it, drink of it\nThen, if you can!\n\nStill, for all slips of hers,\nOne of Eve's family\nWipe those poor lips of hers\nOozing so clammily,\nLoop up her tresses\nEscaped from the comb,\nHer fair auburn tresses;\nWhilst wonderment guesses\nWhere was her home?\n\nWho was her father?\nWho was her mother?\nHad she a sister?\nHad she a brother?\nOr was there a dearer one\nStill, and a nearer one\nYet, than all other?\n\nAlas! for the rarity\nOf Christian charity\nUnder the sun!\nOh! it was pitiful!\nNear a whole city full,\nHome she had none.\n\nSisterly, brotherly,\nFatherly, motherly,\nFeelings had changed:\nLove, by harsh evidence,\nThrown from its eminence;\nEven God's providence\nSeeming estranged.\n\nTake her up tenderly;\nLift her with care;\nFashion'd so slenderly,\nYoung, and so fair!\nEre her limbs frigidly\nStiffen too rigidly,\nDecently, kindly,\nSmooth and compose them;\nAnd her eyes, close them,\nStaring so blindly!\n\nDreadfully staring\nThrough muddy impurity,\nAs when with the daring\nLast look of despairing\nFixed on futurity.\n\nPerhishing gloomily,\nSpurred by contumely,\nCold inhumanity,\nBurning insanity,\nInto her rest,\nCross her hands humbly,\nAs if praying dumbly,\nOver her breast!\nOwning her weakness,\nHer evil behavior,\nAnd leaving, with meekness,\nHer sins to her Saviour!\n\nThe vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. The versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem.\n\nAmong the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:\n\nThough the day of my destiny's over,\nAnd the star of my fate bath declined\nThy soft heart refused to discover\nThe faults which so many could find;\nThough thy soul with my grief was acquainted,\nIt shrunk not to share it with me,\nAnd the love which my spirit bath painted\nIt never bath found but in thee.\n\nThen when nature around me is smiling,\nThe last smile which answers to mine,\nI do not believe it beguiling,\nBecause it reminds me of shine;\nAnd when winds are at war with the ocean,\nAs the breasts I believed in with me,\nIf their billows excite an emotion,\nIt is that they bear me from thee.\n\nThough the rock of my last hope is shivered,\nAnd its fragments are sunk in the wave,\nThough I feel that my soul is delivered\nTo pain it shall not be its slave.\nThere is many a pang to pursue me:\nThey may crush, but they shall not contemn\nThey may torture, but shall not subdue me\n'Tis of thee that I think not of them.\n\nThough human, thou didst not deceive me,\nThough woman, thou didst not forsake,\nThough loved, thou forborest to grieve me,\nThough slandered, thou never couldst shake,\nThough trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,\nThough parted, it was not to fly,\nThough watchful, 'twas not to defame me,\nNor mute, that the world might belie.\n\nYet I blame not the world, nor despise it,\nNor the war of the many with one\nIf my soul was not fitted to prize it,\n'Twas folly not sooner to shun:\nAnd if dearly that error bath cost me,\nAnd more than I once could foresee,\nI have found that whatever it lost me,\nIt could not deprive me of thee.\n\nFrom the wreck of the past, which bath perished,\nThus much I at least may recall,\nIt bath taught me that which I most cherished\nDeserved to be dearest of all:\nIn the desert a fountain is springing,\nIn the wide waste there still is a tree,\nAnd a bird in the solitude singing,\nWhich speaks to my spirit of thee.\n\nAlthough the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification could scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman.\n\nFrom Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen. I call him, and think him the noblest of poets, not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intense but because it is at all times the most ethereal in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet is so little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his last long poem, \"The Princess\":\n\nTears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\nIn looking on the happy Autumn fields,\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\n\nFresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\nSad as the last which reddens over one\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n\nAh, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\nThe earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n\nDear as remember'd kisses after death,\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.\n\nThus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been my purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation of the Principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul, quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For in regard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary Love the true, the divine Eros the Uranian as distinguished from the Diona~an Venus is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And in regard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we experience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect is referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest.\n\nWe shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what the true Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven in the volutes of the flower in the clustering of low shrubberies in the waving of the grain-fields in the slanting of tall eastern trees in the blue distance of mountains in the grouping of clouds in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks in the gleaming of silver rivers in the repose of sequestered lakes in the star-mirroring depths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds in the harp of Bolosin the sighing of the night-wind in the repining voice of the forest in the surf that complains to the shore in the fresh breath of the woodsin the scent of the violet in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odour that comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans, illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts in all unworldly motives in all holy impulses in all chivalrous, generous, and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman in the grace of her step in the lustre of her eye in the melody of her voice in her soft laughter, in her sigh in the harmony of the rustling of her robes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments in her burning enthusiasms in her gentle charities in her meek and devotional endurances but above all ah, far above all, he kneels to it he worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the altogether divine majesty of her love.\n\nLet me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem one very different in character from any that I have before quoted. It is by Motherwell, and is called \"The Song of the Cavalier.\" With our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare, we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier:\n\nThen mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,\nAnd don your helmes amaine:\nDeathe's couriers. Fame and Honor call\nNo shrewish teares shall fill your eye\nWhen the sword-hilt's in our hand,\nHeart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe\nFor the fayrest of the land;\nLet piping swaine, and craven wight,\nThus weepe and poling crye,\nOur business is like men to fight.",

I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,\nOf the hollow and high-sounding vanities\nOf the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile\nWe have been boys together--school-fellows--\nAnd now are friends--yet shall not be so long--\nFor in the Eternal City thou shalt do me\nA kind and gentle office, and a Power--\nA Power august, benignant, and supreme--\nShall then absolve thee of all further duties\nUnto thy friend.\n\nBal.    Thou speakest a fearful riddle\nIwillnot understand.\n\nPol.    Yet now as Fate\nApproaches, and the Hours are breathing low,\nThe sands of Time are changed to golden grains,\nAnd dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!\nIcannotdie, having within my heart\nSo keen a relish for the beautiful\nAs hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air\nIs balmier now than it was wont to be--\nRich melodies are floating in the winds--\nA rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--\nAnd with a holier lustre the quiet moon\nSitteth in Heaven.--Hist! hist! thou canst not say\nThou hearest notnow, Baldazzar?\n\nBal.    Indeed I hear not.\n\nPol.    Not hear it!--listen--now--listen!--the faintest sound\nAnd yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!\nA lady's voice!--and sorrow in the tone!\nBaldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!\nAgain!--again!--how solemnly it falls\nInto my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice\nSurely I never heard--yet it were well\nHad Ibutheard it with its thrilling tones\nIn earlier days!\n\nBal.    I myself hear it now.\nBe still!--the voice, if I mistake not greatly,\nProceeds from younder lattice--which you may see\nVery plainly through the window--it belongs,\nDoes it not? unto this palace of the Duke.\nThe singer is undoubtedly beneath\nThe roof of his Excellency--and perhaps\nIs even that Alessandra of whom he spoke\nAs the betrothed of Castiglione,\nHis son and heir.\n\nPol.    Be still!--it comes again!\n\nVoice\n(very faintly). \"And is thy heart so strong [1]\nAs for to leave me thus,\nThat have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among?\nAnd is thy heart so strong\nAs for to leave me thus?\nSay nay! say nay!\"\n\n\nBal.    The song is English, and I oft have heard it\nIn merry England--never so plaintively--\nHist! hist! it comes again!\n\nVoice\n(more loudly).     \"Is it so strong\nAs for to leave me thus,\nThat have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among?\nAnd is thy heart so strong\nAs for to leave me thus?\nSay nay! say nay!\"\n\nBal.    'Tis hushed and all is still!\n\nPol.    Allis notstill.\n\nBal.    Let us go down.\n\nPol.    Go down, Baldazzar, go!\n\nBal.    The hour is growing late--the Duke awaits us,--\nThy presence is expected in the hall\nBelow. What ails thee, Earl Politian?\n\nVoice\n(distinctly).     \"Who have loved thee so long,\nIn wealth and woe among,\nAnd is thy heart so strong?\nSay nay! say nay!\"\n\nBal.    Let us descend!--'tis time.

Idoremember.\n(going).\nLet us descend. Believe me I would give,\nFreely would give the broad lands of my earldom\nTo look upon the face hidden by yon lattice--\n\"To gaze upon that veiled face, and hear\nOnce more that silent tongue.\"\n\nBal.    Let me beg you, sir,\nDescend with me--the Duke may be offended.\nLet us go down, I pray you.\n\nVoice (loudly).Say nay!--say nay!\n\nPol. (aside). 'Tis strange!--'tis very strange--methought\nthe voice\nChimed in with my desires and bade me stay!\n(Approaching the window)\nSweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.\nNow be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,\nStill will I not descend. Baldazzar, make\nApology unto the Duke for me;\nI go not down to-night.\n\nBal.    Your lordship's pleasure\nShall be attended to. Good-night, Politian.\n\nPol.    Good-night, my friend, good-night.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe Gardens of a Palace--Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN.\n\n\nLalage.     And dost thou speak of love\nTome, Politian?--dost thou speak of love\nTo Lalage?--ah woe--ah woe is me!\nThis mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed!\n\nPolitian.     Weep not! oh, sob not thus!--thy bitter tears\nWill madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage--\nBe comforted! I know--I know it all,\nAndstillI speak of love. Look at me, brightest,\nAnd beautiful Lalage!--turn here thine eyes!\nThou askest me if I could speak of love,\nKnowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen\nThou askest me that--and thus I answer thee--\nThus on my bended knee I answer thee. (kneeling.)\nSweet Lalage,I love thee--love thee--love thee;\nThro' good and ill--thro' weal and woe,I love thee.\nNot mother, with her first-born on her knee,\nThrills with intenser love than I for thee.\nNot on God's altar, in any time or clime,\nBurned there a holier fire than burneth now\nWithin my spirit forthee. And do I love?\n(arising.)\nEven for thy woes I love thee--even for thy woes--\nThy beauty and thy woes.\n\nLal.    Alas, proud Earl,\nThou dost forget thyself, remembering me!\nHow, in thy father's halls, among the maidens\nPure and reproachless of thy princely line,\nCould the dishonored Lalage abide?\nThy wife, and with a tainted memory--\nMy seared and blighted name, how would it tally\nWith the ancestral honors of thy house,\nAnd with thy glory?\n\nPol.    Speak not to me of glory!\nI hate--I loathe the name; I do abhor\nThe unsatisfactory and ideal thing.\nArt thou not Lalage, and I Politian?\nDo I not love--art thou not beautiful--\nWhat need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:\nBy all I hold most sacred and most solemn--\nBy all my wishes now--my fears hereafter--\nBy all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven--\nThere is no deed I would more glory in,\nThan in thy cause to scoff at this same glory\nAnd trample it under foot. What matters it--\nWhat matters it, my fairest, and my best,\nThat we go down unhonored and forgotten\nInto the dust--so we descend together?\nDescend together--and then--and then perchance--\n\nLal.    Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\nPol.    And then perchance\nArisetogether, Lalage, and roam\nThe starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,\nAnd still--\n\nLal.    Why dost thou pause, Politian?\n\nPol.    And stilltogether--together.\n\nLal.    Now, Earl of Leicester!\nThoulovestme, and in my heart of hearts\nI feel thou lovest me truly.\n\nPol.    O Lalage!\n(throwing himself upon his knee.)\nAnd lovest thoume?\n\nLal.    Hist! hush! within the gloom\nOf yonder trees methought a figure passed--\nA spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless--\nLike the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.\n(walks across and returns.)\nI was mistaken--'twas but a giant bough\nStirred by the autumn wind. Politian!\n\nPol.    My Lalage--my love! why art thou moved?\nWhy dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,\nFar less a shadow which thou likenest to it,\nShould shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind\nIs chilly--and these melancholy boughs\nThrow over all things a gloom.\n\nLal.    Politian!\nThou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land\nWith which all tongues are busy--a land new found--\nMiraculously found by one of Genoa--\nA thousand leagues within the golden west?\nA fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,--\nAnd crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,\nAnd mountains, around whose towering summits the winds\nOf Heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe\nIs Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter\nIn days that are to come?\n\nPol.    Oh, wilt thou--wilt thou\nFly to that Paradise--my Lalage, wilt thou\nFly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,\nAnd Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.\nAnd life shall then be mine, for I will live\nFor thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be\nNo more a mourner--but the radiant Joys\nShall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope\nAttend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee\nAnd worship thee, and call thee my beloved,\nMy own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,\nMy all;--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, Lalage,\nFly thither with me?\n\nLal.    A deed is to be done--\nCastiglione lives!\n\nPol.    And he shall die!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nLal.\n(after a pause). And--he--shall--die!--alas!\nCastiglione die? Who spoke the words?\nWhere am I?--what was it he said?--Politian!\nThouartnot gone--thou art notgone, Politian!\nIfeelthou art not gone--yet dare not look,\nLest I behold thee not--thoucouldstnot go\nWith those words upon thy lips--oh, speak to me!\nAnd let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,\nTo say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,\nTo say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate\nMy womanly weakness.

When saw you, sir,\nWhen saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid\nUngenial Britain which we left so lately,\nA heaven so calm as this--so utterly free\nFrom the evil taint of clouds?--and he didsay?\n\nBal.    No more, my lord, than I have told you:\nThe Count Castiglione will not fight.\nHaving no cause for quarrel.\n\nPol.    Now this is true--\nAll very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,\nAnd I have not forgotten it--thou'lt do me\nA piece of service: wilt thou go back and say\nUnto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,\nHold him a villain?--thus much, I pr'ythee, say\nUnto the Count--it is exceeding just\nHe should have cause for quarrel.\n\nBal.    My lord!--my friend!--\n\nPol. (aside). 'Tis he--he comes himself!\n(aloud.) Thou reasonest well.\nI know what thou wouldst say--not send the message--\nWell!--I will think of it--I will not send it.\nNow pr'ythee, leave me--hither doth come a person\nWith whom affairs of a most private nature\nI would adjust.\n\nBal.    I go--to-morrow we meet,\nDo we not?--at the Vatican.\n\nPol.    At the Vatican.\n\n(Exit Bal.)\n\nEnter Castiglione.\n\nCas.    The Earl of Leicester here!\n\nPol.    Iamthe Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,\nDost thou not, that I am here?\n\nCas.    My lord, some strange,\nSome singular mistake--misunderstanding--\nHath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged\nThereby, in heat of anger, to address\nSome words most unaccountable, in writing,\nTo me, Castiglione; the bearer being\nBaldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware\nOf nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,\nHaving given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?\n'Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all\nDo err at times.\n\nPol.    Draw, villain, and prate no more!\n\nCas.    Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,\nProud Earl!\n(Draws.)\n\nPol.\n(drawing.)    Thus to the expiatory tomb,\nUntimely sepulchre, I do devote thee\nIn the name of Lalage!\n\nCas. (letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the stage.)\nOf Lalage!\nHold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!\nAvaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not.\n\nPol.    Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?\nShall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;\nDidst say thoudarestnot? Ha!\n\nCas.    I dare not--dare not--\nHold off thy hand--with that beloved name\nSo fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--\nI cannot--dare not.\n\nPol.    Now, by my halidom,\nI do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!\n\nCas.    Ha!--coward!--this may not be!\n(clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of the Earl.)\nAlas! my lord,\nIt is--it is--most true. In such a cause\nI am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!\n\nPol.\n(greatly softened). Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee.\n\nCas.    And Lalage--\n\nPol.Scoundrel!--arise and die!\n\nCas.    It needeth not be--thus--thus--Oh, let me die\nThus on my bended knee. It were most fitting\nThat in this deep humiliation I perish.\nFor in the fight I will not raise a hand\nAgainst thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--\n(baring his bosom.)\nHere is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--\nStrike home. Iwill notfight thee.\n\nPol.    Now's Death and Hell!\nAm I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted\nTo take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:\nThink not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare\nFor public insult in the streets--before\nThe eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--\nLike an avenging spirit I'll follow thee\nEven unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--\nBefore all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,--I'll taunt thee,\nDost hear? withcowardice--thouwilt notfight me?\nThou liest! thoushalt!\n\n(Exit.)\n\nCas.    Now this indeed is just!\nMost righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven!\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: By Sir Thomas Wyatt.--Ed.]\n\n\n\n\n\n*     *     *     *     *\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE ON POLITIAN\n\n20. Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December 1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; an unpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845 collection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not considered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty and unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor; and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the following fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. The Duke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father of Castiglione her betrothed.\n\n\n\nDuke.     Why do you laugh?\n\nCastiglione.    Indeed.\nI hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not\nOn yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?\nOf the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.\nAlessandra, you and I, you must remember!\nWe were walking in the garden.\n\nDuke.     Perfectly.\nI do remember it--what of it--what then?\n\nCas.    O nothing--nothing at all.\n\nDuke.     Nothing at all!\nIt is most singular that you should laugh\nAt nothing at all!\n\nCas.    Most singular--singular!\n\nDuke.     Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind\nAs tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.\nWhat are you talking of?\n\nCas.    Was it not so?\nWe differed in opinion touching him.\n\nDuke.     Him!--Whom?\n\nCas.    Why, sir, the Earl Politian.\n\nDuke.     The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?\nWe differed, indeed. If I now recollect\nThe words you used were that the Earl you knew\nWas neither learned nor mirthful.\n\nCas.    Ha! ha!--now did I?\n\nDuke.     That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time\nYou were wrong, it being not the character\nOf the Earl--whom all the world allows to be\nA most hilarious man. Be not, my son,\nToo positive again.\n\nCas.    'Tis singular!\nMost singular! I could not think it possible\nSo little time could so much alter one!\nTo say the truth about an hour ago,\nAs I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,\nAll arm in arm, we met this very man\nThe Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,\nHaving just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! heisaltered!\nSuch an account he gave me of his journey!\n'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he told\nOf his caprices and his merry freaks\nAlong the road--such oddity--such humor--\nSuch wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment\nSet off too in such full relief by the grave\nDemeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth\nWas gravity itself--\n\nDuke.     Did I not tell you?\n\nCas.    You did--and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,\nHow much I was mistaken! I always thought\nThe Earl a gloomy man.\n\nDuke.     So, so, you see!\nBe not too positive. Whom have we here?\nIt cannot be the Earl?\n\nCas.    The Earl! Oh no!\nTis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning\nUpon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!\n(Enter Politian and Baldazzar.)\nMy lord, a second welcome let me give you\nTo Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.\nFather! this is the Earl Politian, Earl\nOf Leicester in Great Britain.\n[Politian bows haughtily.]\nThat, his friend\nBaldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,\nSo please you, for Your Grace.\n\nDuke.     Ha! ha! Most welcome\nTo Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!\nAnd you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!\nI knew your father well, my Lord Politian.\nCastiglione! call your cousin hither,\nAnd let me make the noble Earl acquainted\nWith your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time\nMost seasonable. The wedding--\n\nPolitian.     Touching those letters, sir,\nYour son made mention of--your son, is he not?--\nTouching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.\nIf such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--\nBaldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here\nWill hand them to Your Grace. I would retire.\n\nDuke.     Retire!--so soon?\n\nCas.    What ho! Benito! Rupert!\nHis lordship's chambers--show his lordship to them!\nHis lordship is unwell.\n\n(Enter Benito.)\n\nBen.    This way, my lord!\n\n(Exit, followed by Politian.)\n\nDuke.     Retire! Unwell!\n\nBal.    So please you, sir. I fear me\n'Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.\nThe damp air of the evening--the fatigue\nOf a long journey--the--indeed I had better\nFollow his lordship. He must be unwell.\nI will return anon.\n\nDuke.     Return anon!\nNow this is very strange! Castiglione!\nThis way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.\nYou surely were mistaken in what you said\nOf the Earl, mirthful, indeed!--which of us said\nPolitian was a melancholy man?\n\n(Exeunt.)",

By no argument can I persuade �em their gilt carcasses against my bombards avail not. What�s to do, Fox?\n\nFERDINAND. Fatherless folk go furthest. These loud pagans\nAre doubly fatherless. Consider; they came\nOver the passes, out of all man�s world,\nAdullamites, unable to endure\nIts ancient pinch and belly-ache, full of revenges\nOr wilfully forgetful. The land they found\nWas manless-her raw airs uncloven by speech,\nEarth without wheel-track, hoof-mark, hearth or ploughshare\nSince God created; nor even a cave where men,\nWhen night was a new thing, had hid themselves.\n\nGOW. Excellent. Do I fight them, or let go?\n\nFERDINAND. Unused earth, air and water for their spoil,\nAnd none to make comparison of their deeds.\nNo unbribed dead to judge, accuse �em or comfort,\nTheir present all their future and their past.\nWhat should they know of reason, litters of folk,\nNew whelped to emptiness?\n\nGOW. Nothing. They bar my path.\n\nFERDINAND. Turn it, then, turn it.\nGive them their triumph. They�ll be wiser anon,\nSome thirty generations hence.\n\nGOW. Amen! I�m no disposed murderer.

There are none beside ourselves to lead the world!\n\nGOW. That is common knowledge. I supplicate you to allow us the head of the Pass, that we may better reach the Queen�s host yonder. Ye will not? Why?\n\nTHE PRIEST. Because it is our will. There is none other law for all the earth.\n\nGOW. (That a few feet of snow on a nest of rocky mountains should have hatched this dream-people!) (To Priest) Ye have reason in nature, all you�ve known of it . . . But, a thousand years, I fear they will not suffice.\n\nTHE PRIEST. Go you back! We hold the passes into and out of the world. Do you defy us?\n\nFERDINAND. (To Gow) I warned you. There�s none like them under Heaven. Say it!\n\nGOW. Defy your puissance, Se�ors? Not I. We�ll have our bombards away, all, by noon; and our poor hosts with them. And you, Se�ors, shall have your triumph upon us.\n\nFERDINAND. Ah! That touches! Let them shout and blow their horns half a day and they�ll not think of aught else!\n\nGOW. Fall to your riots then! Se�ors, ye have won. We�ll leave you the head of the Pass, for thirty generations. (Loudly) The mules to the bombards and away!\n\nFERDINAND. Most admirably you spoke to my poor text.\n\nGOW. Maybe the better, Fox, because the discourse has drawn them to the head of the Pass.

white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam.\n\nThere was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,\nAnd the Northern Light stood out again, goose-winged to open sea.\n(For life it is that is worse than death, by force of Russian law\nTo work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw.)\nThey had not run a mile from shore, they heard no shots behind,\nWhen the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind:\n\"Bluffed, raised out on a bluff,\" said he, \"for if my name's Tom Hall,\nYou must set a thief to catch a thief, and a thief has caught us all!\nBy every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine,\nThe hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine!\nHe has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar, and, faith, he has faked her well,\nBut I'd know the Stralsund's deckhouse yet from here to the booms o' Hell.\nOh, once we ha' met at Baltimore, and twice on Boston pier,\nBut the sickest day for you, Reuben Paine, was the day that you came here,\nThe day that you came here, my lad, to scare us from our seal\nWith your funnel made o' your painted cloth, and your guns o' rotten deal!\nRing and blow for the Baltic now, and head her back to the bay,\nAnd we'll come into the game again, with a double deck to play!\"\n\nThey rang and blew the sealers' call, the poaching cry of the sea,\nAnd they raised the Baltic out of the mist, and an angry ship was she:\nAnd blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again,\nTill they heard the creak of the Stralsund's boom and the clank of her mooring chain.\nThey laid them down by bitt and boat, their pistols in their belts,\nAnd: \"Will you fight for it, Reuben Paine, or will you share the pelts?\"\n\nA dog-toothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine, and bared his flenching-knife.\n\"Yea, skin for skin, and all that he hath a man will give for his life;\nBut I've six thousand skins below, and Yeddo Port to see,\nAnd there's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three:\nSo go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill,\nAnd I'll be good to your seal this catch, as many as I shall kill!\"\n\nAnswered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid,\nBut the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did.\nThe weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak,\nAnd the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke.\nThe bullets bit on bend and butt, the splinter slivered free\n(Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!),\nThe thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,\nBut three were down on the Baltic's deck and two of the Stralsund's crew.\nAn arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound,\nBut, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound.\nFor one cried out on the Name of God, and one to have him cease,\nAnd the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace;\nAnd one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgin's Name,\nAnd the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came.\nAnd in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath,\nAnd each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth,\nTrigger and ear and eye acock, knit brow and hard-drawn lips,\nBracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships.\nTill they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath,\nTill they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death:\n\n\"The tides they'll go through Fundy Race but I'll go nevermore\nAnd see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore.\nNo more I'll see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground,\nOr watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound.\nSorrow is me, in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall,\nBut if there's law o' God or man you'll swing for it yet, Tom Hall!\"\nTom Hall stood up by the quarter-rail. \"Your words in your teeth,\" said he.\n\"There's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three.\nSo go in grace with Him to face, and an ill-spent life behind,\nAnd I'll be good to your widows, Rube, as many as I shall find.\"\n\nA Stralsund man shot blind and large, and a war-lock Finn was he,\nAnd he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee.\nTom Hall caught hold by the topping-lift, and sat him down with an oath,\n\"You'll wait a little, Rube,\" he said, \"the Devil has called for both.\nThe Devil is driving both this tide, and the killing-grounds are close,\nAnd we'll go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes.\nO men, put back your guns again and lay your rifles by,\nWe've fought our fight, and the best are down. Let up and let us die!\nQuit firing, by the bow there, quit! Call off the Baltic's crew!\nYou're sure of Hell as me or Rube, but wait till we get through.\"\nThere went no word between the ships, but thick and quick and loud\nThe life-blood drummed on the dripping decks, with the fog-dew from the shroud,\nThe sea-pull drew them side by side, gunnel to gunnel laid,\nAnd they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear, but never a word was said.\n\nThen Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed:\n\"Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last?\nCurse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind,\nI have gotten my death where I got my bread, but I dare not face it blind.\nCurse on the fog! Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew\nTo clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?\"\nThe good fog heard, like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore,\nAnd they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore.\nSilver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide,\nAnd pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside.\nO rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread,\nAnd gold, raw gold, the spent shell rolled between the careless dead,\nThe dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee,\nAnd they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see.\n\nAnd a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift,\nBut no man stood by wheel or sheet, and they let the schooners drift.\nAnd the rattle rose in Reuben's throat and he cast his soul with a cry,\nAnd \"Gone already?\" Tom Hall he said. \"Then it's time for me to die.\"\nHis eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land,\nAnd he spoke as a man that talks in dreams, his wound beneath his hand.\n\"Oh, there comes no good o' the westering wind that backs against the sun;\nWash down the decks, they're all too red, and share the skins and run,\nBaltic, Stralsund, and Northern Light, clean share and share for all,\nYou'll find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees, but you will not find Tom Hall.\nEvil he did in shoal-water and blacker sin on the deep,\nBut now he's sick of watch and trick and now he'll turn and sleep.\nHe'll have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so,\nBut he'll lie down on the killing-grounds where the holluschickie go.\nAnd west you'll sail and south again, beyond the sea-fog's rim,\nAnd tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him.\nAnd you'll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside,\nBut carry him up to the sand-hollows to die as Bering died,\nAnd make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fair,\nAnd leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there!\"\n\nHalf-steam ahead by guess and lead, for the sun is mostly veiled,\nThrough fog to fog, by luck and log, sail ye as Bering sailed;\nAnd if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain,\nNorth and by west, from Zapne Crest, ye raise the Crosses Twain.\nFair marks are they to the inner bay, the reckless poacher knows\nWhat time the scarred see-catchie lead their sleek seraglios.\nEver they hear the floe-pack clear, and the blast of the old bull-whale,\nAnd the deep seal-roar that beats off-shore above the loudest gale.\nEver they wait the winter's hate as the thundering boorga calls,\nWhere northward look they to St. George, and westward to St. Paul's.\nEver they greet the hunted fleet, lone keels off headlands drear,\nWhen the sealing-schooners flit that way at hazard year by year.\nEver in Yokohama port men tell the tale anew\nOf a hidden sea and a hidden fight,\nWhen the Baltic ran from the Northern Light\nAnd the Stralsund fought the two.",

Men heard him feed,\nAnd those that heard him sickened where they lay.\nThus came the Sickness to Er-Heb, and slew\nOf men a score, and of the women eight,\nAnd of the children two.\n\nBecause the road\nTo Gorukh was a road of enemies,\nAnd Ao-Safai was blocked with early snow,\nWe could not flee from out the Valley. Death\nSmote at us in a slaughter-pen, and Kysh\nWas mute as Yabosh, though the goats were slain;\nAnd the Red Horse grazed nightly by the stream,\nAnd later, outward, towards the Unlighted Shrine,\nAnd those that heard him sickened where they lay.\n\nThen said Bisesa to the Priests at dusk,\nWhen the white mist rose up breast-high, and choked\nThe voices in the houses of the dead:\n\"Yabosh and Kysh avail not. If the Horse\nReach the Unlighted Shrine we surely die.\nYe have forgotten of all Gods the Chief,\nTaman!\" Here rolled the thunder through the Hills\nAnd Yabosh shook upon his pedestal.\n\"Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief\nToo long.\" And all were dumb save one, who cried\nOn Yabosh with the Sapphire 'twixt His knees,\nBut found no answer in the smoky roof,\nAnd, being smitten of the Sickness, died\nBefore the altar of the Sapphire Shrine.\n\nThen said Bisesa: \"I am near to Death,\nAnd have the Wisdom of the Grave for gift\nTo bear me on the path my feet must tread.\nIf there be wealth on earth, then I am rich,\nFor Armod is the first of all Er-Heb;\nIf there be beauty on the earth,\" her eyes\nDropped for a moment to the temple floor,\n\"Ye know that I am fair. If there be love,\nYe know that love is mine.\" The Chief in War,\nThe Man of Sixty Spears, broke from the press,\nAnd would have clasped her, but the Priests withstood,\nSaying: \"She has a message from Taman.\"\nThen said Bisesa: \"By my wealth and love\nAnd beauty, I am chosen of the God\nTaman.\" Here rolled the thunder through the Hills\nAnd Kysh fell forward on the Mound of Skulls.\n\nIn darkness, and before our Priests, the maid\nBetween the altars cast her bracelets down,\nTherewith the heavy earrings Armod made,\nWhen he was young, out of the water-gold\nOf Gorukh threw the breast-plate thick with jade\nUpon the turquoise anklets put aside\nThe bands of silver on her brow and neck;\nAnd as the trinkets tinkled on the stones,\nThe thunder of Taman lowed like a bull.\n\nThen said Bisesa, stretching out her hands,\nAs one in darkness fearing Devils: \"Help!\nO Priests, I am a woman very weak,\nAnd who am I to know the will of Gods?\nTaman hath called me, whither shall I go?\"\nThe Chief in War, the Man of Sixty Spears,\nHowled in his torment, fettered by the Priests,\nBut dared not come to her to drag her forth,\nAnd dared not lift his spear against the Priests.\nThen all men wept.\n\nThere was a Priest of Kysh\nBent with a hundred winters, hairless, blind,\nAnd taloned as the great Snow-Eagle is.\nHis seat was nearest to the altar-fires,\nAnd he was counted dumb among the Priests.\nBut, whether Kysh decreed, or from Taman\nThe impotent tongue found utterance we know\nAs little as the bats beneath the eaves.\nHe cried so that they heard who stood without:\n\"To the Unlighted Shrine!\" and crept aside\nInto the shadow of his fallen God\nAnd whimpered, and Bisesa went her way.\n\nThat night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,\nDropped as a cloth upon the dead, and rose\nAbove the roofs, and by the Unlighted Shrine\nLay as the slimy water of the troughs\nWhen murrain thins the cattle of Er-Heb:\nAnd through the mist men heard the Red Horse feed.\n\nIn Armod's house they burned Bisesa's dower,\nAnd killed her black bull Tor, and broke her wheel,\nAnd loosed her hair, as for the marriage-feast,\nWith cries more loud than mourning for the dead.\n\nAcross the fields, from Armod's dwelling-place,\nWe heard Bisesa weeping where she passed\nTo seek the Unlighted Shrine; the Red Horse neighed\nAnd followed her, and on the river-mint\nHis hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears.\n\nOut of the mists of evening, as the star\nOf Ao-Safai climbs through the black snow-blur\nTo show the Pass is clear, Bisesa stepped\nUpon the great gray slope of mortised stone,\nThe Causeway of Taman. The Red Horse neighed\nBehind her to the Unlighted Shrine -- then fled\nNorth to the Mountain where his stable lies.\n\nThey know who dared the anger of Taman,\nAnd watched that night above the clinging mists,\nFar up the hill, Bisesa's passing in.\n\nShe set her hand upon the carven door,\nFouled by a myriad bats, and black with time,\nWhereon is graved the Glory of Taman\nIn letters older than the Ao-Safai;\nAnd twice she turned aside and twice she wept,\nCast down upon the threshold, clamouring\nFor him she loved -- the Man of Sixty Spears,\nAnd for her father, -- and the black bull Tor,\nHers and her pride. Yea, twice she turned away\nBefore the awful darkness of the door,\nAnd the great horror of the Wall of Man\nWhere Man is made the plaything of Taman,\nAn Eyeless Face that waits above and laughs.\n\nBut the third time she cried and put her palms\nAgainst the hewn stone leaves, and prayed Taman\nTo spare Er-Heb and take her life for price.\n\nThey know who watched, the doors were rent apart\nAnd closed upon Bisesa, and the rain\nBroke like a flood across the Valley, washed\nThe mist away; but louder than the rain\nThe thunder of Taman filled men with fear.\n\nSome say that from the Unlighted Shrine she cried\nFor succour, very pitifully, thrice,\nAnd others that she sang and had no fear.\nAnd some that there was neither song nor cry,\nBut only thunder and the lashing rain.\n\nHowbeit, in the morning men rose up,\nPerplexed with horror, crowding to the Shrine.\nAnd when Er-Heb was gathered at the doors\nThe Priests made lamentation and passed in\nTo a strange Temple and a God they feared\nBut knew not.\n\nFrom the crevices the grass\nHad thrust the altar-slabs apart, the walls\nWere gray with stains unclean, the roof-beams swelled\nWith many-coloured growth of rottenness,\nAnd lichen veiled the Image of Taman\nIn leprosy. The Basin of the Blood\nAbove the altar held the morning sun:\nA winking ruby on its heart: below,\nFace hid in hands, the maid Bisesa lay.\n\nEr-Heb beyond the Hills of Ao-Safai\nBears witness to the truth, and Ao-Safai\nHath told the men of Gorukh. Thence the tale\nComes westward o'er the peaks to India.",

    "text": "More than a hundred years ago, in a great battle fought near Delhi, an Indian Prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost with a beggar-girl, who had loved him and followed him in all his camps, on his saddle-bow.    He lost the girl when almost within sight of safety.\nA Maratta trooper tells the story:,\n\n\nThe wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck,\nOur hands and scarfs were saffron-dyed for signal of despair,\nWhen we went forth to Paniput to battle with the ~Mlech~,,\nEre we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there.\n\nThrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords,\nThe hawk-winged horse of Damajee, mailed squadrons of the Bhao,\nStark levies of the southern hills, the Deccan's sharpest swords,\nAnd he the harlot's traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao!\n\nThrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared,\nThe low white mists of morning heard the war-conch scream and bray;\nWe called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beard,\nWe rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away.\n\nThe children of the hills of Khost before our lances ran,\nWe drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the pen;\n'Twas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we began,\nA thousand men had saved the charge; he fled the field with ten!\n\nThere was no room to clear a sword, no power to strike a blow,\nFor foot to foot, ay, breast to breast, the battle held us fast,\nSave where the naked hill-men ran, and stabbing from below\nBrought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed.\n\nTo left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood,\nTo right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade,\nAbove the dark ~Upsaras~ flew, beneath us plashed the blood,\nAnd, bellying black against the dust, the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed.\n\nThe Choosers of the Slain.\n\nI saw it fall in smoke and fire, the banner of the Bhao;\nI heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain:,\n\"Ho! Anand Rao Nimbalkhur, ride!    Get aid of Mulhar Rao!\nGo shame his squadrons into fight, the Bhao, the Bhao is slain!\"\n\nThereat, as when a sand-bar breaks in clotted spume and spray,\nWhen rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna water-head,\nBefore their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way;\nBut of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red.\n\nI held by Scindia, my lord, as close as man might hold;\nA Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his life;\nBut Holkar's Horse were flying, and our chiefest chiefs were cold,\nAnd like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife.\n\nI held by Scindia, my lance from butt to tuft was dyed,\nThe froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridle-chain,\nWhat time beneath our horses' feet a maiden rose and cried,\nAnd clung to Scindia, and I turned a sword-cut from the twain.\n\n(He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago,\nA hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water there:\nHe turned her heart to water, and she followed to her woe.\nWhat need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair?)\n\nNow in that hour strength left my lord; he wrenched his mare aside;\nHe bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free.\nAcross the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride\nFrom Paniput to Delhi town, but not alone were we.\n\n'Twas Lutuf-Ullah Populzai laid horse upon our track,\nA swine-fed reiver of the North that lusted for the maid;\nI might have barred his path awhile, but Scindia called me back,\nAnd    I, O woe for Scindia!, I listened and obeyed.\n\nLeague after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by,\nLeague after league the white road swirled behind the white mare's feet,\nLeague after league, when leagues were done, we heard the Populzai,\nWhere sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat.\n\nNoon's eye beheld that shame of flight, the shadows fell, we fled\nWhere steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train;\nThe black wolf warred where we had warred, the jackal mocked our dead,\nAnd terror born of twilight-tide made mad the labouring brain.\n\nI gasped:, \"A kingdom waits my lord; her love is but her own.\nA day shall mar, a day shall cure for her, but what for thee?\nCut loose the girl:    he follows fast.    Cut loose and ride alone!\"\nThen Scindia 'twixt his blistered lips:, \"My Queens' Queen shall she be!\n\n\"Of all who ate my bread last night 'twas she alone that came\nTo seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!\nOne shame is mine to-day, what need the weight of double shame?\nIf once we reach the Delhi gate, though all be lost, I win!\"\n\nWe rode, the white mare failed, her trot a staggering stumble grew,,\nThe cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;\nAnd still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew,\nAnd Delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe.\n\nYea, Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered:, \"Slay!\nLord of my life, the mare sinks fast, stab deep and let me die!\"\nBut Scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,\nAnd turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai.\n\nThen Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,\nAnd wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hand's-breadth in her side,\nThe hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death,\nThe blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died.\n\nOur Gods were kind.    Before he heard the maiden's piteous scream\nA log upon the Delhi road, beneath the mare he lay,\nLost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;\nThe darkness closed about his eyes, I bore my King away.",

With doubtings and spread dismays\n\"We have broken a foolish people, but after many days.\n\"Count we the loss together. Warlocks hampered our arms.\n\"We were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms.\n\"We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep,\n\"But our angry eyes were holden, and we struck as they strike in sleep,\n\"Men new shaken from slumber, sweating with eyes a-stare\n\"Little blows uncertain, dealt on the useless air.\n\"Also a vision betrayed us and a lying tale made bold,\n\"That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold:\nThat a shield should give us shelter, that a sword should give us power,\nA shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour:\n\"That being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close,\n\"And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes.\n\"This was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide,\n\"In our own camp we took them, and their names are Sloth and Pride.\n\"Our pride was before the battle, our sloth ere we lifted spear:\n\"But hid in the heart of the people, as the fever hides in the mere:\n\"Waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise\n\"As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed dries.\n\"But now we are purged of that fever, cleansed by the letting of blood,\n\"Something leaner of body, something keener of mood.\n\"And the men new, freed from the levies return to the fields again,\n\"Matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane;\n\"And they talk loud in the temples where the ancient war- gods are;\n\"They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war.\n\"They jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff.\n\"These things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears and laugh.\n\"The men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they range,\n\"And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change;\n\"And change may be good or evil, but we know not what it will bring;\n\"Therefore our King must teach us. That is thy task, 0 King!\"",

They count their ships full tale, Their corn and oil and wine, Derrick and loom and bale, And ramparts' gun-flecked line; City by City they hail: \"Hast aught to match with mine?\" And the men that breed from them They traffic up and down, But cling to their cities' hem As a child to the mother's gown; When they talk with the stranger bands, Dazed and newly alone; When they walk in the stranger lands, By roaring streets unknown; Blessing her where she stands For strength above their own. (On high to hold her fame That stands all fame beyond, By oath to back the same, Most faithful-foolish-fond; Making her mere-breathed name Their bond upon their bond.) So thank I God my birth Fell not in isles aside, Waste headlands of the earth, Or warring tribes untried, But that she lent me worth And gave me right to pride. Surely in toil or fray Under an alien sky, Comfort it is to say: \"Of no mean city am I!\" (Neither by service nor fee Come I to mine estate, Mother of Cities to me, But I was born in her gate, Between the palms and the sea, Where the world-end steamers wait.) Now for this debt I owe, And for her far-borne cheer Must I make haste and go With tribute to her pier. And she shall touch and remit After the use of kings (Orderly, ancient, fit) My deep-sea plunderings, And purchase in all lands. And this we do for a sign Her power is over mine, And mine I hold at her hands!",

    "text": "More than a hundred years ago, in a great battle fought near Delhi, an Indian Prince rode fifty miles after the day was lost with a beggar-girl, who had loved him and followed him in all his camps, on his saddle-bow. He lost the girl when almost within sight of safety.\nA Maratta trooper tells the story:,\n\n\nThe wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck,\nOur hands and scarfs were saffron-dyed for signal of despair,\nWhen we went forth to Paniput to battle with the Mlech,,\nEre we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there.\n\nThrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords,\nThe hawk-winged horse of Damajee, mailed squadrons of the Bhao,\nStark levies of the southern hills, the Deccan's sharpest swords,\nAnd he the harlot's traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao!\n\nThrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared,\nThe low white mists of morning heard the war-conch scream and bray;\nWe called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beard,\nWe rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away.\n\nThe children of the hills of Khost before our lances ran,\nWe drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the pen;\n'Twas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we began,\nA thousand men had saved the charge; he fled the field with ten!\n\nThere was no room to clear a sword, no power to strike a blow,\nFor foot to foot, ay, breast to breast, the battle held us fast,\nSave where the naked hill-men ran, and stabbing from below\nBrought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed.\n\nTo left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood,\nTo right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade,\nAbove the dark Upsaras* flew, beneath us plashed the blood,\nAnd, bellying black against the dust, the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed.\n\nThe Choosers of the Slain.\n\nI saw it fall in smoke and fire, the banner of the Bhao;\nI heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain:,\n\"Ho! Anand Rao Nimbalkhur, ride! Get aid of Mulhar Rao!\nGo shame his squadrons into fight, the Bhao, the Bhao is slain!\"\n\nThereat, as when a sand-bar breaks in clotted spume and spray,\nWhen rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna water-head,\nBefore their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way;\nBut of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red.\n\nI held by Scindia, my lord, as close as man might hold;\nA Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his life;\nBut Holkar's Horse were flying, and our chiefest chiefs were cold,\nAnd like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife.\n\nI held by Scindia, my lance from butt to tuft was dyed,\nThe froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridle-chain,\nWhat time beneath our horses' feet a maiden rose and cried,\nAnd clung to Scindia, and I turned a sword-cut from the twain.\n\n(He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago,\nA hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water there:\nHe turned her heart to water, and she followed to her woe.\nWhat need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair?)\n\nNow in that hour strength left my lord; he wrenched his mare aside;\nHe bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free.\nAcross the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride\nFrom Paniput to Delhi town, but not alone were we.\n\n'Twas Lutuf-Ullah Populzai laid horse upon our track,\nA swine-fed reiver of the North that lusted for the maid;\nI might have barred his path awhile, but Scindia called me back,\nAnd I, O woe for Scindia!, I listened and obeyed.\n\nLeague after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by,\nLeague after league the white road swirled behind the white mare's feet,\nLeague after league, when leagues were done, we heard the Populzai,\nWhere sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat.\n\nNoon's eye beheld that shame of flight, the shadows fell, we fled\nWhere steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train;\nThe black wolf warred where we had warred, the jackal mocked our dead,\nAnd terror born of twilight-tide made mad the labouring brain.\n\nI gasped:, \"A kingdom waits my lord; her love is but her own.\nA day shall mar, a day shall cure for her, but what for thee?\nCut loose the girl: he follows fast. Cut loose and ride alone!\"\nThen Scindia 'twixt his blistered lips:, \"My Queens' Queen shall she be!\n\n\"Of all who ate my bread last night 'twas she alone that came\nTo seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!\nOne shame is mine to-day, what need the weight of double shame?\nIf once we reach the Delhi gate, though all be lost, I win!\"\n\nWe rode, the white mare failed, her trot a staggering stumble grew,,\nThe cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;\nAnd still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew,\nAnd Delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe.\n\nYea, Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered:, \"Slay!\nLord of my life, the mare sinks fast, stab deep and let me die!\"\nBut Scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,\nAnd turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai.\n\nThen Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,\nAnd wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hand's-breadth in her side,\nThe hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death,\nThe blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died.\n\nOur Gods were kind. Before he heard the maiden's piteous scream\nA log upon the Delhi road, beneath the mare he lay,\nLost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;\nThe darkness closed about his eyes, I bore my King away.",

Who knows not Fortune, glutted on easy thrones,\nStealing from feasts as rare to coney-catch\nPrivily in the hedgerows for a clown,\nWith that same cruel-lustful hand and eye,\nThose nails and wedges, that one hammer and lead,\nAnd the very gerb of long-stored lightning loosed.\nYesterday �gainst some King.\n\nTHE KING.

held that they might not see\nThe kine that grazed beneath the knowes,\nOh, they were the Queens o' Faerie!\n\n\"Now cease your song,\" the King he said,\n\"Oh, cease your song and get you dight\nTo

page and squire\nThat am a king in my own countrie?\n\n\"For I send east and I send west,\nAnd I send far as my will may flee,\nBy dawn and dusk and the drinking rain,\nAnd syne my Sendings return to me.\n\n\"They come wi' news of the groanin' earth,\nThey come wi' news o' the roarin' sea,\nWi' word of Spirit and Ghost and Flesh,\nAnd man, that's mazed among the three.\"\n\nThe King he bit his nether lip,\nAnd smote his hand upon his knee:\n\"By the faith o' my soul, True Thomas,\" he said,\n\"Ye waste no wit in courtesie!\n\n\"As I desire, unto my pride,\nCan I make Earls by three and three,\nTo run before and ride behind\nAnd serve the sons o' my body.\"\n\n\"And what care I for your row-foot earls,\nOr all the sons o' your body?\nBefore they win to the Pride o' Name,\nI trow they all ask leave o' me.\n\n\"For I make Honour wi' muckle mouth,\nAs I make Shame wi' mincin' feet,\nTo sing wi' the priests at the market-cross,\nOr run wi' the dogs in the naked street.\n\n\"And some they give me the good red gold,\nAnd some they give me the white money,\nAnd some they give me a clout o' meal,\nFor they be people o' low degree.\n\n\"And the song I sing for the counted gold\nThe same I sing for the white money,\nBut best I sing for the clout o' meal\nThat simple people given me.\"\n\nThe King cast down a silver groat,\nA silver groat o' Scots money,\n\"If I come wi' a poor man's dole,\" he said,\n\"True Thomas, will ye harp to me?\"\n\n\"Whenas I harp to the children small,\nThey press me close on either hand.\nAnd who are you,\" True Thomas said,\n\"That you should ride while they must stand?\n\n\"Light down, light down from your horse o' pride,\nI trow ye talk too loud and hie,\nAnd I will make you a triple word,\nAnd syne, if ye dare, ye shall 'noble me.\"\n\nHe has lighted down from his horse o' pride,\nAnd set his back against the stone.\n\"Now guard you well,\" True Thomas said,\n\"Ere I rax your heart from your breast-bone!\"\n\nTrue Thomas played upon his harp,\nThe fairy harp that couldna lee,\nAnd the first least word the proud King heard,\nIt harpit the salt tear out o' his ee.\n\n\"Oh, I see the love that I lost long syne,\nI touch the hope that I may not see,\nAnd all that I did o' hidden shame,\nLike little snakes they hiss at me.\n\n\"The sun is lost at noon at noon!\nThe dread o' doom has grippit me.\nTrue Thomas, hide me under your cloak,\nGod wot, I'm little fit to dee!\"\n\n'Twas bent beneath and blue above\n'Twas open field and running flood\nWhere, hot on heath and dike and wall,\nThe high sun warmed the adder's brood.\n\n\"Lie down, lie down,\" True Thomas said.\n\"The God shall judge when all is done.\nBut I will bring you a better word\nAnd lift the cloud that I laid on.\"\n\nTrue Thomas played upon his harp,\nThat birled and brattled to his hand,\nAnd the next least word True Thomas made,\nIt garred the King take horse and brand.\n\n\"Oh, I hear the tread o' the fighting men,\nI see the sun on splent and spear.\nI mark the arrow outen the fern\nThat flies so low and sings so clear!\n\n\"Advance my standards to that war,\nAnd bid my good knights prick and ride;\nThe gled shall watch as fierce a fight\nAs e'er was fought on the Border side!\"\n\n'Twas bent beneath and blue above,\n'Twas nodding grass and naked sky,\nWhere, ringing up the wastrel wind,\nThe eyas stooped upon the pie.\n\nTrue Thomas sighed above his harp,\nAnd turned the song on the midmost string;\nAnd the last least word True Thomas made,\nHe harpit his dead youth back to the King.\n\n\"Now I am prince, and I do well\nTo love my love withouten fear;\nTo walk wi' man in fellowship,\nAnd breathe my horse behind the deer.\n\n\"My hounds they bay unto the death,\nThe buck has couched beyond the burn,\nMy love she waits at her window\nTo wash my hands when I return.\n\n\"For that I live am I content\n(Oh! I have seen my true love's eyes)\nTo stand wi' Adam in Eden-glade,\nAnd run in the woods o' Paradise!\"\n\n'Twas naked sky and nodding grass,\n'Twas running flood and wastrel wind,\nWhere, checked against the open pass,\nThe red deer belled to call the hind.\n\nTrue Thomas laid his harp away,\nAnd louted low at the saddle-side;\nHe has taken stirrup and hauden rein,\nAnd set the King on his horse o' pride.\n\n\"Sleep ye or wake,\" True Thomas said,\n\"That sit so still, that muse so long;\nSleep ye or wake? till the latter sleep\nI trow ye'll not forget my song.\n\n\"I ha' harpit a shadow out o' the sun\nTo stand before your face and cry;\nI ha' armed the earth beneath your heel,\nAnd over your head I ha' dusked the sky.\n\n\"I ha' harpit ye up to the throne o' God,\nI ha' harpit your midmost soul in three;\nI ha' harpit ye down to the Hinges o' Hell,\nAnd ye would make a Knight o' me!\"",

Sleep and dream of the kill.\nI am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come to me! Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot.\nBring up the great bull-buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd-bulls with the angry eyes.

Why?\nI dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy. My mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but my heart is very light because I have come back to the jungle.\nWhy?\nThese two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the spring.

Go and find it. Go and look behind the Ranges,\n\"Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and wating for you. Go!\"\n\nSo I went, worn out of patience; never told my nearest neighbours,\nStole away with pack and ponies, left 'em drinking in the town;\nAnd the faith that moveth mountains didn't seem to help my labours\nAs I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down.\n\nMarch by march I puzzled through 'em, turning flanks and dodging shoulders,\nHurried on in hope of water, headed back for lack of grass;\nTill I camped above the tree-line, drifted snow and naked boulders,\nFelt free air astir to windward, knew I'd stumbled on the Pass.\n\n'Thought to name it for the finder: but that night the Norther found me,\nFroze and killed the plains-bred ponies; so I called the camp Despair\n(It's the Railway Gap to-day, though).

They'll be called the Pioneers!\n\nThey will find my sites of townships, not the cities that I set there.\nThey will rediscover rivers, not my rivers heard at night.\nBy my own old marks and bearings they will show me how to get there,\nBy the lonely cairns I builded they will guide my feet aright.\n\nHave I named one single river? Have I claimed one single acre?\nHave I kept one single nugget, (barring samples)? No, not I!\nBecause my price was paid me ten times over by my Maker.\nBut you wouldn't understand it.

    "text": "This is the ballad of Boh Da Thone,\nErst a Pretender to Theebaw's throne,\nWho harried the district of Alalone:\nHow he met with his fate and the V.P.P.*\nAt the hand of Harendra Mukerji,\nSenior Gomashta, G.B.T.\n\nBoh Da Thone was a warrior bold:\nHis sword and his rifle were bossed with gold,\n\nAnd the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore\nWas stiff with bullion, but stiffer with gore.\n\nHe shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak\nFrom the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak:\n\nHe crucified noble, he sacrificed mean,\nHe filled old ladies with kerosene:\n\nWhile over the water the papers cried,\n\"The patriot fights for his countryside!\"\n\nBut little they cared for the Native Press,\nThe worn white soldiers in Khaki dress,\n\nWho tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre,\nWho died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire,\n\nWho gave up their lives, at the Queen's Command,\nFor the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land.\n\nNow, first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone\nWas Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone,\n\nAnd his was a Company, seventy strong,\nWho hustled that dissolute Chief along.\n\nThere were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath\nWho went to their death with a joke in their teeth,\n\nAnd worshipped with fluency, fervour, and zeal\nThe mud on the boot-heels of \"Crook\" O'Neil.\n\nBut ever a blight on their labours lay,\nAnd ever their quarry would vanish away,\n\nTill the sun-dried boys of the Black Tyrone\nTook a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone:\n\nAnd, sooth, if pursuit in possession ends,\nThe Boh and his trackers were best of friends.\n\nThe word of a scout a march by night\nA rush through the mist a scattering fight\n\nA volley from cover a corpse in the clearing\nThe glimpse of a loin-cloth and heavy jade earring\n\nThe flare of a village the tally of slain\nAnd... the Boh was abroad on the raid again!\n\nThey cursed their luck, as the Irish will,\nThey gave him credit for cunning and skill,\n\nThey buried their dead, they bolted their beef,\nAnd started anew on the track of the thief\n\nTill, in place of the \"Kalends of Greece\", men said,\n\"When Crook and his darlings come back with the head.\"\n\nThey had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain\nHe doubled and broke for the hills again:\n\nThey had crippled his power for rapine and raid,\nThey had routed him out of his pet stockade,\n\nAnd at last, they came, when the Daystar tired,\nTo a camp deserted a village fired.\n\nA black cross blistered the morning-gold,\nAnd the body upon it was stark and cold.\n\nThe wind of the dawn went merrily past,\nThe high grass bowed her plumes to the blast.\n\nAnd out of the grass, on a sudden, broke\nA spirtle of fire, a whorl of smoke\n\nAnd Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone\nWas blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone\nThe gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone.\n\n(Now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire\nIs a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire.)\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe shot-wound festered as shot-wounds may\nIn a steaming barrack at Mandalay.\n\nThe left arm throbbed, and the Captain swore,\n\"I'd like to be after the Boh once more!\"\n\nThe fever held him the Captain said,\n\"I'd give a hundred to look at his head!\"\n\nThe Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred,\nBut Babu Harendra (Gomashta) heard.\n\nHe thought of the cane-brake, green and dank,\nThat girdled his home by the Dacca tank.\n\nHe thought of his wife and his High School son,\nHe thought but abandoned the thought of a gun.\n\nHis sleep was broken by visions dread\nOf a shining Boh with a silver head.\n\nHe kept his counsel and went his way,\nAnd swindled the cartmen of half their pay.\n\n. . . . .\n\nAnd the months went on, as the worst must do,\nAnd the Boh returned to the raid anew.\n\nBut the Captain had quitted the long-drawn strife,\nAnd in far Simoorie had taken a wife;\n\nAnd she was a damsel of delicate mould,\nWith hair like the sunshine and heart of gold,\n\nAnd little she knew the arms that embraced\nHad cloven a man from the brow to the waist:\n\nAnd little she knew that the loving lips\nHad ordered a quivering life's eclipse,\n\nOr the eye that lit at her lightest breath\nHad glared unawed in the Gates of Death.\n\n(For these be matters a man would hide,\nAs a general rule, from an innocent Bride.)\n\nAnd little the Captain thought of the past,\nAnd, of all men, Babu Harendra last.\n\n. . . . .\n\nBut slow, in the sludge of the Kathun road,\nThe Government Bullock Train toted its load.\n\nSpeckless and spotless and shining with ghi,\nIn the rearmost cart sat the Babu-jee.\n\nAnd ever a phantom before him fled\nOf a scowling Boh with a silver head.\n\nThen the lead-cart stuck, though the coolies slaved,\nAnd the cartmen flogged and the escort raved;\n\nAnd out of the jungle, with yells and squeals,\nPranced Boh Da Thone, and his gang at his heels!\n\nThen belching blunderbuss answered back\nThe Snider's snarl and the carbine's crack,\n\nAnd the blithe revolver began to sing\nTo the blade that twanged on the locking-ring,\n\nAnd the brown flesh blued where the bay'net kissed,\nAs the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist,\n\nAnd the great white oxen with onyx eyes\nWatched the souls of the dead arise,\n\nAnd over the smoke of the fusillade\nThe Peacock Banner staggered and swayed.\n\nOh, gayest of scrimmages man may see\nIs a well-worked rush on the G.B.T.!\n\nThe Babu shook at the horrible sight,\nAnd girded his ponderous loins for flight,\n\nBut Fate had ordained that the Boh should start\nOn a lone-hand raid of the rearmost cart,\n\nAnd out of that cart, with a bellow of woe,\nThe Babu fell flat on the top of the Boh!\n\nFor years had Harendra served the State,\nTo the growth of his purse and the girth of his p]^et.\n\nThere were twenty stone, as the tally-man knows,\nOn the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs.\n\nAnd twenty stone from a height discharged\nAre bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged.\n\nOh, short was the struggle severe was the shock\nHe dropped like a bullock he lay like a block;\n\nAnd the Babu above him, convulsed with fear,\nHeard the labouring life-breath hissed out in his ear.\n\nAnd thus in a fashion undignified\nThe princely pest of the Chindwin died.\n\n. . . . .\n\nTurn now to Simoorie where, lapped in his ease,\nThe Captain is petting the Bride on his knees,\n\nWhere the whit of the bullet, the wounded man's scream\nAre mixed as the mist of some devilish dream\n\nForgotten, forgotten the sweat of the shambles\nWhere the hill-daisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols,\n\nFrom the sword-belt set free and released from the steel,\nThe Peace of the Lord is on Captain O'Neil.\n\n. . . . .\n\nUp the hill to Simoorie most patient of drudges\nThe bags on his shoulder, the mail-runner trudges.\n\n\"For Captain O'Neil, Sahib. One hundred and ten\nRupees to collect on delivery.\"\nThen\n\n(Their breakfast was stopped while the screw-jack and hammer\nTore waxcloth, split teak-wood, and chipped out the dammer;)\n\nOpen-eyed, open-mouthed, on the napery's snow,\nWith a crash and a thud, rolled the Head of the Boh!\n\nAnd gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran:\n\"In fielding force service\".\nEncampment,\n10th Jan.\n\n\"Dear Sir, I have honour to send, as you said,\nFor final approval (see under) Boh's Head;\n\n\"Was took by myself in most bloody affair.\nBy High Education brought pressure to bear.\n\n\"Now violate Liberty, time being bad,\nTo mail V.P.P. (rupees hundred) Please add\n\n\"Whatever Your Honour can pass. Price of Blood\nMuch cheap at one hundred, and children want food;\n\n\"So trusting Your Honour will somewhat retain\nTrue love and affection for Govt. Bullock Train,\n\n\"And show awful kindness to satisfy me,\nI am,\nGraceful Master,\nYour\nH. Mukerji.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nAs the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnake's power,\nAs the smoker's eye fills at the opium hour,\n\nAs a horse reaches up to the manger above,\nAs the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love,\n\nFrom the arms of the Bride, iron-visaged and slow,\nThe Captain bent down to the Head of the Boh.\n\nAnd e'en as he looked on the Thing where It lay\n'Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins' array,\n\nThe freed mind fled back to the long-ago days\nThe hand-to-hand scuffle the smoke and the blaze\n\nThe forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn\nThe banjo at twilight, the burial ere morn\n\nThe stench of the marshes the raw, piercing smell\nWhen the overhand stabbing-cut silenced the yell\n\nThe oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood\nWhere the black crosses hung o'er the Kuttamow flood.\n\nAs a derelict ship drifts away with the tide\nThe Captain went out on the Past from his Bride,\n\nBack, back, through the springs to the chill of the year,\nWhen he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer.\n\nAs the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water,\nIn his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter,\n\nAnd men who had fought with O'Neil for the life\nHad gazed on his face with less dread than his wife.\n\nFor she who had held him so long could not hold him\nThough a four-month Eternity should have controlled him\n\nBut watched the twin Terror the head turned to head\nThe scowling, scarred Black, and the flushed savage Red\n\nThe spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to\nSome grim hidden Past she had never a clue to.\n\nBut It knew as It grinned, for he touched it unfearing,\nAnd muttered aloud, \"So you kept that jade earring!\"\n\nThen nodded, and kindly, as friend nods to friend,\n\"Old man, you fought well, but you lost in the end.\"\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe visions departed, and Shame followed Passion:\n\"He took what I said in this horrible fashion,\n\n\"I'll write to Harendra!\" With language unsainted\nThe Captain came back to the Bride. . .who had fainted.\n\n. . . . .\n\nAnd this is a fiction? No. Go to Simoorie\nAnd look at their baby, a twelve-month old Houri,\n\nA pert little, Irish-eyed Kathleen Mavournin\nShe's always about on the Mall of a mornin'\n\nAnd you'll see, if her right shoulder-strap is displaced,\nThis: Gules upon argent, a Boh's Head, erased!",

I could tell you what I did\nSome nights of Eighty-Five, at Simla, worth\nA Kingdom's ransom. When a big ship drives,\nGod knows to what new reef the man at the whee!\nPrays with the passengers. They lose their lives,\nOr rescued go their way; but he's no man\nTo take his trick at the wheel again that's worse\nThan drowning. Well, a galled Mashobra mule\n(You'll see Mashobra) passed me on the Mall,\nAnd I was some fool's wife and ducked and bowed\nTo show the others I would stop and speak.\nThen the mule fell three galls, a hund-breadth each,\nBehind the withers. Mrs. Whatsisname\nLeers at the mule and me by turns, thweet thoul!\n\"How could they make him carry such a load!\"\nI saw it isn't often I dream dreams\nMore than the mule that minute smoke and flame\nFrom Simla to the haze below. That's weak.\nYou're younger. You'll dream dreams before you've done.\nYou've youth, that's one good workmen that means two\nFair chances in your favor. Fate's the third.\nI know what I did. Do you ask me, \"Preach\"?\nI answer by my past or else go back\nTo platitudes of rule or take you thus\nIn confidence and say: \"You know the trick:\nYou've governed Canada. You know. You know!\"\nAnd all the while commend you to Fate's hand\n(Here at the top on loses sight o' God),\nCommend you, then, to something more than you\nThe Other People's blunders and\n. . . that's all.\nI'd agonize to serve you if I could.\nIt's incommunicable, like the cast\nThat drops the tackle with the gut adry.\nToo much too little there's your salmon lost!\nAnd so I tell you nothing with you luck,\nAnd wonder how I wonder! for your sake\nAnd triumph for my own. You're young, you're young,\nYou hold to half a hundred Shibboleths.\nI'm old. I followed Power to the last,\nGave her my best, and Power followed Me.\nIt's worth it on my sould I'm speaking plain,\nHere by the claret glasses! worth it all.\nI gave no matter what I gave I win.\nI know I win. Mine's work, good work that lives!\nA country twice the size of France the North\nSafeguarded. That's my record: sink the rest\nAnd better if you can. The Rains may serve,\nRupees may rise three pence will give you Fame\nIt's rash to hope for sixpence If they rise\nGet guns, more guns, and lift the salt-tax.\nOh!\nI told you what the Congress meant or thought?\nI'll answer nothing. Half a year will prove\nThe full extent of time and thought you'll spare\nTo Congress. Ask a Lady Doctor once\nHow little Begums see the light deduce\nThence how the True Reformer's child is born.\nIt's interesting, curious . . . and vile.\nI told the Turk he was a gentlman.\nI told the Russian that his Tartar veins\nBled pure Parisian ichor; and he purred.\nThe Congress doesn't purr. I think it swears.\nYou're young you'll swear to ere you've reached the end.\nThe End! God help you, if there be a God.\n(There must be one to startle Gl-dst-ne's soul\nIn that new land where all the wires are cut.\nAnd Cr-ss snores anthems on the asphodel.)\nGod help you! And I'd help you if I could,\nBut that's beyond me. Yes, your speech was crude.\nSound claret after olives yours and mine;\nBut Medoc slips into vin ordinaire.\n(I'll drink my first at Genoa to your health.)\nRaise it to Hock. You'll never catch my style.\nAnd, after all, the middle-classes grip\nThe middle-class for Brompton talk Earl's Court.\nPerhaps you're right. I'll see you in the Times\nA quarter-column of eye-searing print,\nA leader once a quarter then a war;\nThe Strand abellow through the fog: \"Defeat!\"\n\"'Orrible slaughter!\" While you lie awake\nAnd wonder. Oh, you'll wonder ere you're free!\nI wonder now. The four years slide away\nSo fast, so fast, and leave me here alone.\nR-y, C-lv-n, L-l, R-b-rts, B-ck, the rest,\nPrinces and Powers of Darkness troops and trains,\n(I cannot sleep in trains), land piled on land,\nWhitewash and weariness, red rockets, dust,\nWhite snows that mocked me, palaces with draughts,\nAnd W-stl-nd with the drafts he couldn't pay,\nPoor W-ls-n reading his obituary.\nBefore he died, and H-pe, the man with bones,\nAnd A-tch-s-n a dripping mackintosh\nAt Council in the Rains, his grating \"Sirrr\"\nHalf drowned by H-nt-r's silky: \"Bat my lahnd.\"\nHunterian always: M-rsh-l spinning plates\nOr standing on his head; the Rent Bill's roar,\nA hundred thousand speeches, must red cloth,\nAnd Smiths thrice happy if I call them Jones,\n(I can't remember half their names) or reined\nMy pony on the Mall to greet their wives.\nMore trains, more troops, more dust, and then all's done.\nFour years, and I forget. If I forget\nHow will they bear me in their minds? The North\nSafeguarded nearly (R-b-rts knows the rest),\nA country twice the size of France annexed.\nThat stays at least. The rest may pass may pass\nYour heritage and I can teach you nought.\n\"High trust,\" \"vast honor,\" \"interests twice as vast,\"\n\"Due reverence to your Council\" keep to those.\nI envy you the twenty years you've gained,\nBut not the five to follow. What's that? One?\nTwo! Surely not so late. Good-night. Don't dream.",

With brow serene\nThe subaltern softly answered 'Teen'.\nHe haggled an hour, that dealer thrifty\nTill the price was lowered to do sow fifty\nAnd the money was paid in greasy rupees\nWhile the red-roan gelding drowsed at his ease.\nThe subaltern left him, and Ahmed smiled,\n'By Allah, how mad is this pink-faced child\nI will stuff that ghorah with attah and goor\nAnd sell him again to some English soor\nFor a clear eight-fifty!\"... and e'en as he spoke\nThe devil they'd drugged in the red-roan woke !\nThen the head-ropes snapped and the heel-ropes drew\nAnd the stallions squealed as the roan went through\nAnd the syces ran as men run for life\nAnd the yard was troubled with equine strife\nTill the berserk-rage of the beat was o'er\nAnd he dropped to slumber at Ahmed's door!\n\nThen a veil was lifted from Ahmed's eyes\nAnd he raised the eyelids and punched the thighs\nFelt the tense pulse slacken, the muscles still,\nAnd fathomed the Trcik of the Opium Pill!\nHis own old dodge that had brought him pelf\nHad the subaltern turned against himself!\n\nDid he swear, though his three best tats were lame\nAnd half of the city would hear of his shame ?\nDid he seek the law courts? With downcast eye\nHe hailed an ekka that jingled by,\nAnd drove to the station, where filled with peace\nThe subaltern counted the greasy rupees.\n\nWhat passed between them? I cannot say,\nThe subaltern turns the question away\nWith an innocent laugh: but the men of Morar\nSay he still gets ponies from Ahmed Shah.\nPonies to bet on, but not to buy,\nWeeds to look at but devils to fly\nAnd once in a while comes a tiny pill-box.\nThe Doctor abets him...

Go forth, for it is there!\"\n\nThe West Wind called:, \"In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly\nThat bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die.\nThey make my might their porter, they make my house their path,\nTill I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath.\n\n\"I draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole,\nThey bellow one to the other, the frighted ship-bells toll,\nFor day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath,\nAnd they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death.\n\n\"But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day,\nI heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,\nFirst of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,\nDipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.\n\n\"The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it, the frozen dews have kissed,\nThe naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist.\nWhat is the Flag of England? Ye have but my breath to dare,\nYe have but my waves to conquer. Go forth, for it is there!\"",

I took my job and I stuck;\nAnd I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck.\nLord, what boats I've handled, rotten and leaky and old!\nRan 'em, or, opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told.\nGrub that 'ud bind you crazy, and crews that 'ud turn you grey,\nAnd a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way.\nThe others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life\n(They've served me since as skippers). I went, and I took my wife.\nOver the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three,\nAnd your mother saving the money and making a man of me.\nI was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;\nShe took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind.\nShe egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan,\nWhen we bought half shares in a cheap 'un and hoisted a flag of our own.\nPatching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how,\nWe started the Red Ox freighters, we've eight-and-thirty now.\nAnd those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,\nAnd we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits,\nBy the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank,\nAnd we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank.\nOwners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,\nAnd she died in the Mary Gloster. My heart, how young we were!\nSo I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore,\nBut your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more:\nStrict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think,\nSaving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink.\nAnd I met M'Cullough in London (I'd turned five 'undred then),\nAnd 'tween us we started the Foundry, three forges and twenty men:\nCheap repairs for the cheap 'uns. It paid, and the business grew,\nFor I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too.\n\"Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em,\" I said, but M'Cullough he shied,\nAnd we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde.\nAnd the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,\nBuilding our engines like houses and staying the boilers square.\nBut M'Cullough 'e wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,\nAnd Brussels an' Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall,\nAnd pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light,\nBut M'Cullough he died in the Sixties, and, Well, I'm dying to-night. . . .\nI knew, I knew what was coming, when we bid on the Byfleet's keel,\nThey piddled and piffled with iron: I'd given my orders for steel!\nSteel and the first expansions. It paid, I tell you, it paid,\nWhen we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade!\nAnd they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text,\n\"You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!\"\nThey copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,\nAnd I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.\nThen came the armour-contracts, but that was M'Cullough's side;\nHe was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died.\nI went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;\nAnd I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint.\n(I remember his widow was angry.) So I saw what the drawings meant,\nAnd I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent,\nSixty per cent with failures, and more than twice we could do,\nAnd a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you!\nI thought, it doesn't matter, you seemed to favour your ma,\nBut you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are.\nHarrer an' Trinity College! I ought to ha' sent you to sea,\nBut I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?\nThe things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,\nAnd the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live.\nFor you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans,\nAnd your rooms at college was beastly, more like a whore's than a man's,\nTill you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,\nAn' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?\nI've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the Cromwell Road,\nBut never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.\n(So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.)\nNot like your mother, she isn't. She carried her freight each run.\nBut they died, the pore little beggars! At sea she had 'em, they died.\nOnly you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside.\nWeak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp\nNosing for scraps in the galley. No help, my son was no help!\nSo he gets three 'undred thousand, in trust and the interest paid.\nI wouldn't give it you, Dickie, you see, I made it in trade.\nYou're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,\nIt all comes back to the business. Gad, won't your wife be wild!\n'Calls and calls in her carriage, her 'andkerchief up to 'er eye:\n\"Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!\" and doing her best to cry.\nGrateful?

That's how.\nAn' a man 'e must go with a woman, as you could not understand;\nBut I never talked 'em secrets. I paid 'em out o' hand.\nThank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies! Now what's five thousand to me,\nFor a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be?\nI believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain,\nBut I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again.\nFor the heart it shall go with the treasure, go down to the sea in ships.\nI'm sick of the hired women, I'll kiss my girl on her lips!\nI'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well,\nAnd the wife of my youth shall charm me, an' the rest can go to Hell!\n(Dickie, he will, that's certain.)

Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily\ndispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the\ncamp for Collatine. They came--the one accompanied with Junius\nBrutus, the other with Publius Valerius--and, finding Lucrece attired\nin mourning habit, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She,\nfirst taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor and\nwhole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself.\nWhich done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole\nhated family of the Tarquins; and, bearing the dead body to Rome,\nBrutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile\ndeed, with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the King, wherewith\nthe people were so moved that with one consent and a general\nacclamation the Tarquins were all exiled and the state government\nchanged from kings to consuls.",

the first forth-stepping armies?\nAsk room, alas, the ghastly ranks - the armies dread that follow'd.\n\n(Pass - pass, ye proud brigades!\nSo handsome, dress'd in blue - with your tramping, sinewy legs;\nWith your shoulders young and strong - with your knapsacks and your muskets;\n- How elate I stood and watch'd you, where, starting off, you march'd!\n\nPass; - then rattle, drums, again!\nScream, you steamers on the river, out of whistles loud and shrill, your salutes!\nFor an army heaves in sight - O another gathering army!\nSwarming, trailing on the rear - O you dread, accruing army!\nO you regiments so piteous, with your mortal diarrhoea! with your fever!\nO my land's maimed darlings! with the plenteous bloody bandage and the crutch!\nLo! your pallid army follow'd!)\n\nBut on these days of brightness,\nOn the far-stretching beauteous landscape, the roads and lanes, the high-piled farm-wagons, and the fruits and barns,\nShall the dead intrude?\n\nAh, the dead to me mar not - they fit well in Nature;\nThey fit very well in the landscape, under the trees and grass,\nAnd along the edge of the sky, in the horizon's far margin.\n\nNor do I forget you, departed;\nNor in winter or summer, my lost ones;\nBut most, in the open air, as now, when my soul is rapt and at peace - like pleasing phantoms,\nYour dear memories, rising, glide silently by me.\n\nI saw the day, the return of the Heroes;\n(Yet the Heroes never surpass'd, shall never return;\nThem, that day, I saw not.)\n\nI saw the interminable Corps - I saw the processions of armies,\nI saw them approaching, defiling by, with divisions,\nStreaming northward, their work done, camping awhile in clusters of mighty camps.\n\nNo holiday soldiers! - youthful, yet veterans;\nWorn, swart, handsome, strong, of the stock of homestead and workshop,\nHarden'd of many a long campaign and sweaty march,\nInured on many a hard-fought, bloody field.\n\nA pause - the armies wait;\nA million flush'd, embattled conquerors wait;\nThe world, too, waits - then, soft as breaking night, and sure as dawn,\nThey melt - they disappear.\n\nExult, indeed, O lands! victorious lands!\nNot there your victory, on those red, shuddering fields;\nBut here and hence your victory.\n\nMelt, melt away, ye armies! disperse, ye blue-clad soldiers!\nResolve ye back again - give up, for good, your deadly arms;\nOther the arms, the fields henceforth for you, or South or North, or\nEast or West,\nWith saner wars - sweet wars - life-giving wars.\n\nLoud, O my throat, and clear, O soul!\nThe season of thanks, and the voice of full-yielding;\nThe chant of joy and power for boundless fertility.\n\nAll till'd and untill'd fields expand before me;\nI see the true arenas of my race - or first, or last,\nMan's innocent and strong arenas.\n\nI see the Heroes at other toils;\nI see, well-wielded in their hands, the better weapons.\n\nI see where America, Mother of All,\nWell-pleased, with full-spanning eye, gazes forth, dwells long,\nAnd counts the varied gathering of the products.\n\nBusy the far, the sunlit panorama;\nPrairie, orchard, and yellow grain of the North,\nCotton and rice of the South, and Louisianian cane;\nOpen, unseeded fallows, rich fields of clover and timothy,\nKine and horses feeding, and droves of sheep and swine,\nAnd many a stately river flowing, and many a jocund brook,\nAnd healthy uplands with their herby-perfumed breezes,\nAnd the good green grass - that delicate miracle, the ever-recurring grass.\n\nToil on, Heroes! harvest the products!\nNot alone on those warlike fields, the Mother of All,\nWith dilated form and lambent eyes, watch'd you.\n\nToil on, Heroes! toil well! Handle the weapons well!\nThe Mother of All - yet here, as ever, she watches you.\n\nWell-pleased, America, thou beholdest,\nOver the fields of the West, those crawling monsters,\nThe human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements:\nBeholdest, moving in every direction, imbued as with life, the revolving hay-rakes,\nThe steam-power reaping-machines, and the horse-power machines,\nThe engines, thrashers of grain, and cleaners of grain, well separating the straw - the nimble work of the patent pitch-fork;\nBeholdest the newer saw-mill, the southern cotton-gin, and the rice-cleanser.\n\nBeneath thy look, O Maternal,\nWith these, and else, and with their own strong hands, the Heroes harvest.\n\nAll gather, and all harvest;\n(Yet but for thee, O Powerful! not a scythe might swing, as now, in security;\nNot a maize-stalk dangle, as now, its silken tassels in peace.)\n\nUnder Thee only they harvest - even but a wisp of hay, under thy great face, only;\nHarvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin - every barbed spear, under thee;\nHarvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee - each ear in its light-green sheath,\nGather the hay to its myriad mows, in the odorous, tranquil barns,\nOats to their bins - the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;\nGather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama - dig and hoard the golden, the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,\nClip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,\nCut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp, or tobacco in the Borders,\nPick the pea and the bean, or pull apples from the trees, or bunches of grapes from the vines,\nOr aught that ripens in all These States, or North or South,\nUnder the beaming sun, and under Thee.",

Was the sea risen?\nWas the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?\nLo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage;\nManhattan, rising, advancing with menacing front Cincinnati, Chicago, unchain'd;\nWhat was that swell I saw on the ocean? behold what comes here!\nHow it climbs with daring feet and hands! how it dashes!\nHow the true thunder bellows after the lightning! how bright the flashes of lightning!\nHow democracy, with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the dark by those flashes of lightning!\n(Yet a mournful wail and low sob I fancied I heard through the dark,\nIn a lull of the deafening confusion.)\n\nThunder on! stride on, Democracy! strike with vengeful stroke!\nAnd do you rise higher than ever yet, O days, O cities!\nCrash heavier, heavier yet, O storms! you have done me good;\nMy soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong nutriment;\nLong had I walk'd my cities, my country roads, through farms, only half-satisfied;\nOne doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawl'd on the ground before me,\nContinually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing low;\nThe cities I loved so well, I abandon'd and left I sped to the certainties suitable to me;\nHungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies, and Nature's dauntlessness,\nI refresh'd myself with it only, I could relish it only;\nI waited the bursting forth of the pent fire on the water and air I waited long;\nBut now I no longer wait I am fully satisfied I am glutted;\nI have witness'd the true lightning I have witness'd my cities electric;\nI have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike America rise;\nHence I will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,\nNo more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea.",

    "text": "I wander all night in my vision,\nStepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,\nBending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,\nWandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,\nPausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.\n\nHow solemn they look there, stretch'd and still!\nHow quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles!\n\nThe wretched features of ennuy�s, the white features of\ncorpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,\nThe gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,\nThe night pervades them and infolds them.\n\nThe married couple sleep calmly in their bed he with his palm on the\nhip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,\nThe sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,\nThe men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,\nAnd the mother sleeps, with her little child carefully wrapt.\n\nThe blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,\nThe prisoner sleeps well in the prison the run-away son sleeps;\nThe murderer that is to be hung next day how does he sleep?\nAnd the murder'd person how does he sleep?\n\nThe female that loves unrequited sleeps,\nAnd the male that loves unrequited sleeps,\nThe head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,\nAnd the enraged and treacherous dispositions all, all sleep.\n\nI stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and the most restless,\nI pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,\nThe restless sink in their beds they fitfully sleep.\n\nNow I pierce the darkness new beings appear,\nThe earth recedes from me into the night,\nI saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is beautiful.\n\nI go from bedside to bedside I sleep close with the other sleepers, each in turn,\nI dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,\nAnd I become the other dreamers.\n\nI am a dance Play up, there! the fit is whirling me fast!\n\nI am the ever-laughing it is new moon and twilight,\nI see the hiding of douceurs I see nimble ghosts whichever way I look,\nCache, and cache again, deep in the ground and sea, and where it is neither ground or sea.\n\nWell do they do their jobs, those journeymen divine,\nOnly from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,\nI reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet besides,\nAnd surround me and lead me, and run ahead when I walk,\nTo lift their cunning covers, to signify me with stretch'd arms, and resume the way;\nOnward we move! a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting music, and wild-flapping pennants of joy!\n\nI am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician;\nThe emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,\nHe who has been famous, and he who shall be famous after to-day,\nThe stammerer, the well-form'd person, the wasted or feeble person.\n\nI am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,\nMy truant lover has come, and it is dark.\n\nDouble yourself and receive me, darkness!\nReceive me and my lover too he will not let me go without him.\n\nI roll myself upon you, as upon a bed I resign myself to the dusk.\n\nHe whom I call answers me, and takes the place of my lover,\nHe rises with me silently from the bed.\n\nDarkness! you are gentler than my lover his flesh was sweaty and panting,\nI feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.\n\nMy hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,\nI would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.\n\nBe careful, darkness! already, what was it touch'd me?\nI thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,\nI hear the heart-beat I follow, I fade away.\n\nO hot-cheek'd and blushing! O foolish hectic!\nO for pity's sake, no one must see me now! my clothes were stolen while I was abed,\nNow I am thrust forth, where shall I run?\n\nPier that I saw dimly last night, when I look'd from the windows!\nPier out from the main, let me catch myself with you, and stay I will not chafe you,\nI feel ashamed to go naked about the world.\n\nI am curious to know where my feet stand and what this is flooding me, childhood or manhood and the hunger that crosses the bridge between.\n\nThe cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking,\nLaps life-swelling yolks laps ear of rose-corn, milky and just ripen'd;\nThe white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances in darkness,\nAnd liquor is spill'd on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the best liquor afterward.\n\nI descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,\nPerfume and youth course through me, and I am their wake.\n\nIt is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old woman's,\nI sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn my grandson's stockings.\n\nIt is I too, the sleepless widow, looking out on the winter midnight,\nI see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.\n\nA shroud I see, and I am the shroud I wrap a body, and lie in the coffin,\nIt is dark here under ground it is not evil or pain here it is blank here, for reasons.\n\nIt seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be happy,\nWhoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know he has enough.\n\nI see a beautiful gigantic swimmer, swimming naked through the eddies of the sea,\nHis brown hair lies close and even to his head he strikes out with courageous arms he urges himself with his legs,\nI see his white body I see his undaunted eyes,\nI hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks.\n\nWhat are you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled waves?\nWill you kill the courageous giant? Will you kill him in the prime of his middle age?\n\nSteady and long he struggles,\nHe is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd he holds out while his strength holds out,\nThe slapping eddies are spotted with his blood they bear him away they roll him, swing him, turn him,\nHis beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis'd on rocks,\nSwiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.\n\nI turn, but do not extricate myself,\nConfused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.\n\nThe beach is cut by the razory ice-wind the wreck-guns sound,\nThe tempest lulls the moon comes floundering through the drifts.\n\nI look where the ship helplessly heads end on I hear the burst as\nshe strikes I hear the howls of dismay they grow fainter and fainter.\n\nI cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\nI can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\n\nI search with the crowd not one of the company is wash'd to us alive;\nIn the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\n\nNow of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\nWashington stands inside the lines he stands on the intrench'd hills, amid a crowd of officers,\nHis face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weeping drops,\nHe lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes the color is blanch'd from his cheeks,\nHe sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents.\n\nThe same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern the well-belov'd soldiers all pass through,\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the cheek,\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another he shakes hands, and bids good-by to the army.\n\nNow I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat at dinner together,\nOf when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on the old homestead.\n\nA red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead,\nOn her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd her face,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke.\n\nMy mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and pliant limbs,\nThe more she look'd upon her, she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace she cook'd food for her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\n\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away,\nO my mother was loth to have her go away!\nAll the week she thought of her she watch'd for her many a month,\nShe remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,\nBut the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again.\n\nNow Lucifer was not dead or if he was, I am his sorrowful terrible heir;\nI have been wrong'd I am oppress'd I hate him that oppresses me,\nI will either destroy him, or he shall release me.\n\nDamn him! how he does defile me!\nHow he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their blood!\nHow he laughs when I look down the bend, after the steamboat that carries away my woman!\n\nNow the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk, it seems mine;\nWarily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my flukes is death.\n\nA show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an amour of the light and air!\nI am jealous, and overwhelm'd with friendliness,\nAnd will go gallivant with the light and air myself,\nAnd have an unseen something to be in contact with them also.\n\nO love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in me!\nAutumn and winter are in the dreams the farmer goes with his thrift,\nThe droves and crops increase, and the barns are well-fill'd.\n\nElements merge in the night ships make tacks in the dreams,\nThe sailor sails the exile returns home,\nThe fugitive returns unharm'd the immigrant is back beyond months and years,\nThe poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with the well-known neighbors and faces,\nThey warmly welcome him he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off;\nThe Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home,\nTo every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd ships,\nThe Swiss foots it toward his hills the Prussian goes his way, the\nHungarian his way, and the Pole his way,\nThe Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.\n\nThe homeward bound, and the outward bound,\nThe beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuy�, the onanist, the female that loves unrequited, the money-maker,\nThe actor and actress, those through with their parts, and those waiting to commence,\nThe affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee that is chosen, and the nominee that has fail'd,\nThe great already known, and the great any time after to-day,\nThe stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,\nThe criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience,\nThe laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw,\nThe consumptive, the erysipelite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,\nThe antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,\nI swear they are averaged now one is no better than the other,\nThe night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.\n\nI swear they are all beautiful;\nEvery one that sleeps is beautiful everything in the dim light is beautiful,\nThe wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.\n\nPeace is always beautiful, The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.\n\nThe myth of heaven indicates the Soul;\nThe Soul is always beautiful it appears more or it appears less it comes, or it lags behind,\nIt comes from its embower'd garden, and looks pleasantly on itself, and encloses the world,\nPerfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and clean the womb cohering,\nThe head well-grown, proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and joints proportion'd and plumb.\n\nThe Soul is always beautiful,\nThe universe is duly in order, everything is in its place,\nWhat has arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place;\nThe twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,\nThe child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,\nThe sleepers that lived and died wait the far advanced are to go on in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,\nThe diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite they unite now.\n\nThe sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,\nThey flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from east to west, as they lie unclothed,\nThe Asiatic and African are hand in hand the European and American are hand in hand,\nLearn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand in hand,\nThe bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover they press close without lust his lips press her neck,\nThe father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with measureless love,\nThe white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter,\nThe breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is inarm'd by friend,\nThe scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses the scholar the wrong'd is made right,\nThe call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master salutes the slave,\nThe felon steps forth from the prison the insane becomes sane the suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,\nThe sweatings and fevers stop the throat that was unsound is sound the lungs of the consumptive are resumed the poor distress'd head is free,\nThe joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever,\nStiflings and passages open the paralyzed become supple,\nThe swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves in condition,\nThey pass the invigoration of the night, and the chemistry of the night, and awake.\n\nI too pass from the night,\nI stay a while away, O night, but I return to you again, and love you.\n\nWhy should I be afraid to trust myself to you?\nI am not afraid I have been well brought forward by you;\nI love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long,\nI know not how I came of you, and I know not where I go with you but\nI know I came well, and shall go well.\n\nI will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes;\nI will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly return to you.",

Cities and States in Thee!\nOur freedom all in Thee! our very lives in Thee!",

serpentine pennants,\nThe large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot- houses,\nThe white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,\nThe flags of all nations, the falling of them at sun-set,\nThe scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening,\nThe stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite store-houses by the docks,\nOn the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on each side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,\nOn the neighboring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night,\nCasting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light, over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.\n\n\nThese, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you;\nI project myself a moment to tell you--also I return.\n\nI loved well those cities;\nI loved well the stately and rapid river;\nThe men and women I saw were all near to me;\nOthers the same--others who look back on me, because I look'd forward to them;\n(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)\n\n\nWhat is it, then, between us?\nWhat is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?\n\nWhatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not.\n\n\nI too lived--Brooklyn, of ample hills, was mine;\nI too walk'd the streets of Manhattan Island, and bathed in the waters around it;\nI too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,\nIn the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,\nIn my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my bed, they came upon me.\n\nI too had been struck from the float forever held in solution;\nI too had receiv'd identity by my Body;\nThat I was, I knew was of my body--and what I should be, I knew I should be of my body.\n\n\nIt is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,\nThe dark threw patches down upon me also;\nThe best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious;\nMy great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? would not people laugh at me?\n\nIt is not you alone who know what it is to be evil;\nI am he who knew what it was to be evil;\nI too knitted the old knot of contrariety,\nBlabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,\nHad guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,\nWas wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant;\nThe wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,\nThe cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,\nRefusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting.\n\n\nBut I was Manhattanese, friendly and proud!\nI was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,\nFelt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,\nSaw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly, yet never told them a word,\nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,\nPlay'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,\nThe same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,\nOr as small as we like, or both great and small.\n\n\nCloser yet I approach you;\nWhat thought you have of me, I had as much of you--I laid in my stores in advance;\nI consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.\n\nWho was to know what should come home to me?\nWho knows but I am enjoying this?\nWho knows but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?\n\nIt is not you alone, nor I alone;\nNot a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries;\nIt is that each came, or comes, or shall come, from its due emission,\nFrom the general centre of all, and forming a part of all:\nEverything indicates--the smallest does, and the largest does;\nA necessary film envelopes all, and envelopes the Soul for a proper time.\n\n\nNow I am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to me than my mast-hemm'd Manhattan,\nMy river and sun-set, and my scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide,\nThe sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter;\nCurious what Gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach;\nCurious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face,\nWhich fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you.\n\nWe understand, then, do we not?\nWhat I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?\nWhat the study could not teach--what the preaching could not\naccomplish, is accomplish'd, is it not?\nWhat the push of reading could not start, is started by me\npersonally, is it not?\n\n\nFlow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!\nFrolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!\nGorgeous clouds of the sun-set! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me;\nCross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!\nStand up, tall masts of Mannahatta!--stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!\nThrob, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!\nSuspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!\nGaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public assembly!\nSound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name!\nLive, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!\nPlay the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one makes it!\n\nConsider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you;\nBe firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current;\nFly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;\nReceive the summer sky, you water! and faithfully hold it, till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you;\nDiverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one's head, in the sun-lit water;\nCome on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd schooners, sloops, lighters!\nFlaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset;\nBurn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses;\nAppearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are;\nYou necessary film, continue to envelop the soul;\nAbout my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas;\nThrive, cities! bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers;\nExpand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual;\nKeep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.\n\n\nWe descend upon you and all things--we arrest you all;\nWe realize the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids;\nThrough you color, form, location, sublimity, ideality;\nThrough you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and determinations of ourselves.\n\nYou have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers! you novices!\nWe receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward;\nNot you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us;\nWe use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us;\nWe fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also;\nYou furnish your parts toward eternity;\nGreat or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.",

recruits are drilling and exercising;\nThere is the camp one regiment departs to-morrow;\nDo you hear the officers giving the orders?\nDo you hear the clank of the muskets?\n\nWhy, what comes over you now, old man?\nWhy do you tremble, and clutch my hand so convulsively?\nThe troops are but drilling they are yet surrounded with smiles;\nAround them, at hand, the well-drest friends, and the women;\nWhile splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down;\nGreen the midsummer verdure, and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\nO'er proud and peaceful cities, and arm of the sea between.\nBut drill and parade are over they march back to quarters;\nOnly hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\n\nAs wending, the crowds now part and disperse but we, old man,\nNot for nothing have I brought you hither we must remain;\nYou to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\n\n\nTHE CENTENARIAN.\n\nWhen I clutch'd your hand, it was not with terror;\nBut suddenly, pouring about me here, on every side,\nAnd below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,\nAnd where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see, south and south-east and south-west,\nOver hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,\nAnd along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over), came again, and suddenly raged,\nAs eighty-five years agone, no mere parade receiv'd with applause of friends,\nBut a battle, which I took part in myself aye, long ago as it is, I took part in it,\nWalking then this hill-top, this same ground.\n\nAye, this is the ground;\nMy blind eyes, even as I speak, behold it re-peopled from graves;\nThe years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear;\nRude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted;\nI see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay;\nI mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes:\nHere we lay encamp'd it was this time in summer also.\n\nAs I talk, I remember all I remember the Declaration;\nIt was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here;\nBy his staff surrounded, the General stood in the middle he held up his unsheath'd sword,\nIt glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.\n\n'Twas a bold act then;\nThe English war-ships had just arrived the king had sent them from over the sea;\nWe could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\nAnd the transports, swarming with soldiers.\n\nA few days more, and they landed and then the battle.\n\nTwenty thousand were brought against us,\nA veteran force, furnish'd with good artillery.\n\nI tell not now the whole of the battle;\nBut one brigade, early in the forenoon, order'd forward to engage the red-coats;\nOf that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,\nAnd how long and how well it stood, confronting death.\n\nWho do you think that was, marching steadily, sternly confronting death?\nIt was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\nRais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and many of them known personally to the General.\n\nJauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters;\nTill of a sudden, unlook'd for, by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,\nThe British advancing, wedging in from the east, fiercely playing their guns,\nThat brigade of the youngest was cut off, and at the enemy's mercy.\n\nThe General watch'd them from this hill;\nThey made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment;\nThen drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle;\nBut O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\n\nIt sickens me yet, that slaughter!\nI saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General;\nI saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\n\nMeanwhile the British maneuver'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle;\nBut we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.\n\nWe fought the fight in detachments;\nSallying forth, we fought at several points but in each the luck was against us;\nOur foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to the works on this hill;\nTill we turn'd, menacing, here, and then he left us.\n\nThat was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong;\nFew return'd nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\n\nThat, and here, my General's first battle;\nNo women looking on, nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude with applause;\nNobody clapp'd hands here then.\n\nBut in darkness, in mist, on the ground, under a chill rain,\nWearied that night we lay, foil'd and sullen;\nWhile scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord, off against us encamp'd,\nQuite within hearing, feasting, klinking wine-glasses together over their victory.\n\nSo, dull and damp, and another day;\nBut the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\nSilent as a ghost, while they thought they were sure of him, my General retreated.\n\nI saw him at the river-side,\nDown by the ferry, lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\nMy General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over;\nAnd then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last time.\n\nEvery one else seem'd fill'd with gloom;\nMany no doubt thought of capitulation.\n\nBut when my General pass'd me,\nAs he stood in his boat, and look'd toward the coming sun,\nI saw something different from capitulation.\n\n\nTERMINUS.\n\nEnough the Centenarian's story ends;\nThe two, the past and present, have interchanged;\nI myself, as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\n\nAnd is this the ground Washington trod?\nAnd these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross'd,\nAs resolute in defeat, as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\n\nIt is well a lesson like that, always comes good;\nI must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward;\nI must preserve that look, as it beam'd on you, rivers of Brooklyn.\n\nSee! as the annual round returns, the phantoms return;\nIt is the 27th of August, and the British have landed;\nThe battle begins, and goes against us behold! through the smoke, Washington's face;\nThe brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept the enemy;\nThey are cut off murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them;\nRank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\nBaptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,\nIn death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.\n\nAh, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable than your owners supposed;\nAh, river! henceforth you will be illumin'd to me at sunrise with something besides the sun.\n\nEncampments new! in the midst of you stands an encampment very old;\nStands forever the camp of the dead brigade.",

the bent head, the curv'd neck, and the counting;\nSuch-like I love - I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's breast with the little child,\nSwim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, and count.\n\nI know a man, a common farmer - the father of five sons;\nAnd in them were the fathers of sons - and in them were the fathers of sons.\n\nThis man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;\nThe shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes - the richness and breadth of his manners,\nThese I used to go and visit him to see - he was wise also;\nHe was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old - his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome;\nThey and his daughters loved him - all who saw him loved him;\nThey did not love him by allowance - they loved him with personal love;\nHe drank water only - the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face;\nHe was a frequent gunner and fisher - he sail'd his boat himself - he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner - he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that loved him;\nWhen he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang.\n\nYou would wish long and long to be with him - you would wish to sit by him in the boat, that you and he might touch each other.\n\n\nI have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,\nTo stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\nTo be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\nTo pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment - what is this, then?\nI do not ask any more delight - I swim in it, as in a sea.\n\nThere is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well;\nAll things please the soul - but these please the soul well.\n\n\nThis is the female form;\nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;\nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!\nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor - all falls aside but myself and it;\nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds, and what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed;\nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it - the response likewise ungovernable;\nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused - mine too diffused;\nEbb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb - love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching;\nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice;\nBridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn;\nUndulating into the willing and yielding day,\nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh'd day.\n\nThis is the nucleus - after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman;\nThis is the bath of birth - this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.\n\nBe not ashamed, women - your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest;\nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\n\nThe female contains all qualities, and tempers them - she is in her place, and moves with perfect balance;\nShe is all things duly veil'd - she is both passive and active;\nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\n\nAs I see my soul reflected in nature;\nAs I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty,\nSee the bent head, and arms folded over the breast - the female I see.\n\n\nThe male is not less the soul, nor more - he too is in his place;\nHe too is all qualities - he is action and power;\nThe flush of the known universe is in him;\nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;\nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him well - pride is for him;\nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;\nKnowledge becomes him - he likes it always - he brings everything to the test of himself;\nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only here;\n(Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)\n\nThe man's body is sacred, and the woman's body is sacred;\nNo matter who it is, it is sacred;\nIs it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?\nEach belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well-off - just as much as you;\nEach has his or her place in the procession.\n\n(All is a procession;\nThe universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.)\n\nDo you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull-face ignorant?\nDo you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?\nDo you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float - and the soil is on the surface, and water runs, and vegetation sprouts,\nFor you only, and not for him and her?\n\n\nA man's Body at auction;\nI help the auctioneer - the sloven does not half know his business.\n\nGentlemen, look on this wonder!\nWhatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it;\nFor it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one animal or plant;\nFor it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd.\n\nIn this head the all-baffling brain;\nIn it and below it, the makings of heroes.\n\nExamine these limbs, red, black, or white - they are so cunning in tendon and nerve;\nThey shall be stript, that you may see them.\n\nExquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,\nFlakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,\nAnd wonders within there yet.\n\nWithin there runs blood,\nThe same old blood!\nThe same red-running blood!\nThere swells and jets a heart - there all passions, desires,\nreachings, aspirations; 110\nDo you think they are not there because they are not express'd in parlors and lecture-rooms?\n\nThis is not only one man - this is the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns;\nIn him the start of populous states and rich republics;\nOf him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and enjoyments.\n\nHow do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?\nWho might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?\n\n\nA woman's Body at auction!\nShe too is not only herself - she is the teeming mother of mothers;\nShe is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.\n\nHave you ever loved the Body of a woman?\nHave you ever loved the Body of a man?\nYour father - where is your father?\nYour mother - is she living? have you been much with her? and has she been much with you?\nDo you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all over the earth?\n\nIf any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred,\nAnd the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted;\nAnd in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is beautiful as the most beautiful face.\n\nHave you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?\nFor they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.\n\n\nO my Body!

mould! pile the words of the earth!\nWork on--(it is materials you must bring, not breaths;)\nWork on, age after age! nothing is to be lost;\nIt may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use;\nWhen the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear.\n\nI swear to you the architects shall appear without fail! I announce them and lead them;\nI swear to you they will understand you, and justify you;\nI swear to you the greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and encloses all, and is faithful to all;\nI swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget you--they shall perceive that you are not an iota less than they;\nI swear to you, you shall be glorified in them.",

Do you hear the ironical echoes?)\n\nBooks, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride, beat up and down, seeking to give satisfaction;\nHe indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down also.\n\nWhichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly and gently and safely, by day or by night;\nHe has the pass-key of hearts - to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs.\n\nHis welcome is universal - the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is;\nThe person he favors by day, or sleeps with at night, is blessed.\n\n\nEvery existence has its idiom - everything has an idiom and tongue;\nHe resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and any man translates, and any man translates himself also;\nOne part does not counteract another part - he is the joiner - he sees how they join.\n\nHe says indifferently and alike, How are you, friend? to the President at his levee,\nAnd he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,\nAnd both understand him, and know that his speech is right.\n\nHe walks with perfect ease in the Capitol,\nHe walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another,\nHere is our equal, appearing and new.\n\nThen the mechanics take him for a mechanic,\nAnd the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he\nhas follow'd the sea,\nAnd the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,\nAnd the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them;\nNo matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has follow'd it,\nNo matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters there.\n\nThe English believe he comes of their English stock,\nA Jew to the Jew he seems - a Russ to the Russ - usual and near, removed from none.\n\nWhoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,\nThe Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the German is sure, and the\nSpaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is sure;\nThe engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or Sacramento, or Hudson, or Paumanok Sound, claims him.\n\nThe gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood;\nThe insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves in the ways of him - he strangely transmutes them,\nThey are not vile any more - they hardly know themselves, they are so grown.",

original makers--not mere amanuenses?\nDoes it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face?\nWhat does it mean to me? to American persons, progresses, cities?\nChicago, Kanada, Arkansas? the planter, Yankee, Georgian, native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States?\nDoes it encompass all The States, and the unexceptional rights of all the men and women of the earth? (the genital impulse of These States;)\nDoes it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians, standing, menacing, silent--the mechanics, Manhattanese, western men, southerners, significant alike in their apathy, and in the promptness of their love?\nDoes it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen, each temporizer, patcher, outsider, partialist, alarmist, infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of America?\nWhat mocking and scornful negligence?\nThe track strew'd with the dust of skeletons;\nBy the roadside others disdainfully toss'd.\n\n\nRhymes and rhymers pass away--poems distill'd from foreign poems pass away,\nThe swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes;\nAdmirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of literature;\nAmerica justifies itself, give it time--no disguise can deceive it, or conceal from it--it is impassive enough,\nOnly toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them,\nIf its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them--there is no fear of mistake,\n(The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb'd it.)\n\nHe masters whose spirit masters--he tastes sweetest who results sweetest in the long run;\nThe blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint;\nIn the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an appropriate native grand-opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she is greatest who contributes the greatest original practical example.\n\nAlready a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets,\nPeople's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers; There will shortly be no more priests--I say their work is done,\nDeath is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies here,\nAre your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be superb;\nJustice, health, self-esteem, clear the way with irresistible power;\nHow dare you place anything before a man?\n\n\nFall behind me, States!\nA man before all--myself, typical before all.\n\nGive me the pay I have served for!\nGive me to sing the song of the great Idea! take all the rest;\nI have loved the earth, sun, animals--I have despised riches,\nI have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid and crazy, devoted my income and labor to others,\nI have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God, had patience and indulgence toward the people, taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown,\nI have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the mothers of families,\nI have read these leaves to myself in the open air--I have tried them by trees, stars, rivers,\nI have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own Soul or defiled my Body,\nI have claim'd nothing to myself which I have not carefully claim'd for others on the same terms,\nI have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every State;\n(In war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, America--sadly I boast;\nUpon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his last;\nThis arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored,\nTo life recalling many a prostrate form:)\n--I am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself,\nI reject none, I permit all.\n\n(Say, O mother!

Is the beginningless past nothing?\nIf the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing.\n\nTo think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were\nflexible, real, alive! that everything was alive!\nTo think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part!\nTo think that we are now here, and bear our part!\n\nNot a day passes, not a minute or second, without an accouchement!\nNot a day passes, not a minute or second, without a corpse!\n\nThe dull nights go over, and the dull days also,\nThe soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,\nThe physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look for an answer,\nThe children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters are sent for,\nMedicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has long pervaded the rooms,)\nThe faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,\nThe twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,\nThe breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,\nThe corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,\nIt is palpable as the living are palpable.\n\nThe living look upon the corpse with their eye-sight,\nBut without eye-sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the corpse.\n\nTo think the thought of Death, merged in the thought of materials!\nTo think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits ripen, and act upon others as upon us now, yet not act upon us!\nTo think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great interest in them, and we taking no interest in them!\n\nTo think how eager we are in building our houses!\nTo think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent!\n\n(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or eighty years at most,\nI see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)\n\nSlow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth, they never cease, they are the burial lines,\nHe that was President was buried, and he that is now President shall surely be buried.\n\nA reminiscence of the vulgar fate,\nA frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,\nEach after his kind:\nCold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets, a gray, discouraged sky overhead, the short, last daylight of Twelfth-month,\nA hearse and stages, other vehicles give place, the funeral of an old\nBroadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.\n\nSteady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse uncloses,\nThe coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,\nThe mound above is flatted with the spades, silence,\nA minute, no one moves or speaks, it is done,\nHe is decently put away, is there anything more?\n\nHe was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking, able to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution, died, aged forty-one years, and that was his funeral.\n\nThumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning-in at night;\nTo think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers, and he there takes no interest in them!\n\nThe markets, the government, the working-man's wages, to think what account they are through our nights and days!\nTo think that other working-men will make just as great account of them, yet we make little or no account!\n\nThe vulgar and the refined, what you call sin, and what you call goodness, to think how wide a difference!\nTo think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond the difference.\n\nTo think how much pleasure there is!\nHave you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems?\nDo you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a nomination and election? or with your wife and family?\nOr with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful maternal cares?\nThese also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,\nBut in due time, you and I shall take less interest in them.\n\nYour farm, profits, crops,, to think how engross'd you are!\nTo think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you, of what avail?\n\nWhat will be, will be well, for what is, is well,\nTo take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.\n\nThe sky continues beautiful,\nThe pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of women with men, nor the pleasure from poems,\nThe domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of houses, these are not phantasms, they have weight, form, location;\nFarms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them phantasms,\nThe difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,\nThe earth is not an echo, man and his life, and all the things of his life, are well-consider'd.\n\nYou are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and safely around yourself;\nYourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever!\n\nIt is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father, it is to identify you;\nIt is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided;\nSomething long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you,\nYou are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.\n\nThe threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp, the pattern is systematic.\n\nThe preparations have every one been justified,\nThe orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments, the baton has given the signal.\n\nThe guest that was coming, he waited long, for reasons, he is now housed,\nHe is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of those that to look upon and be with is enough.\n\nThe law of the past cannot be eluded,\nThe law of the present and future cannot be eluded,\nThe law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,\nThe law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,\nThe law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,\nThe law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota thereof can be eluded.\n\nSlow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,\nNortherner goes carried, and Southerner goes carried, and they on the Atlantic side, and they on the Pacific, and they between, and all through the Mississippi country, and all over the earth.\n\nThe great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes and good-doers are well,\nThe known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and distinguish'd, may be well,\nBut there is more account than that, there is strict account of all.\n\nThe interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,\nThe barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,\nThe common people of Europe are not nothing, the American aborigines are not nothing,\nThe infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing, the murderer or mean person is not nothing,\nThe perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go,\nThe lowest prostitute is not nothing, the mocker of religion is not nothing as he goes.\n\nOf and in all these things,\nI have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us changed,\nI have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and past law,\nAnd that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past law,\nFor I have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough.\n\nIf otherwise, all came but to ashes of dung,\nIf maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are betray'd!\nThen indeed suspicion of death.\n\nDo you suspect death? If I were to suspect death, I should die now,\nDo you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?\n\nPleasantly and well-suited I walk,\nWhither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,\nThe whole universe indicates that it is good,\nThe past and the present indicate that it is good.\n\nHow beautiful and perfect are the animals!\nHow perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!\n\nWhat is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,\nThe vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids are perfect;\nSlowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely they yet pass on.\n\nI swear I think now that everything without exception has an eternal Soul!\nThe trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the animals!\n\nI swear I think there is nothing but immortality!\nThat the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is for it;\nAnd all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and materials are altogether for it!",

all.\n\nWhat widens within you, Walt Whitman?\nWhat waves and soils exuding?\nWhat climes? what persons and lands are here?\nWho are the infants? some playing, some slumbering?\nWho are the girls? who are the married women?\nWho are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms about each other's necks?\nWhat rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?\nWhat are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?\nWhat myriads of dwellings are they, fill'd with dwellers?\n\n\nWithin me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;\nAsia, Africa, Europe, are to the east America is provided for in the west;\nBanding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,\nCuriously north and south turn the axis-ends;\nWithin me is the longest day the sun wheels in slanting rings it does not set for months;\nStretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon, and sinks again;\nWithin me zones, seas, cataracts, plants, volcanoes, groups,\nMalaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.\n\n\nWhat do you hear, Walt Whitman?\n\nI hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife singing;\nI hear in the distance the sounds of children, and of animals early in the day;\nI hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East Tennessee and Kentucky, hunting on hills;\nI hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the wild horse;\nI hear the Spanish dance, with castanets, in the chestnut shade, to the rebeck and guitar;\nI hear continual echoes from the Thames;\nI hear fierce French liberty songs;\nI hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical recitative of old poems;\nI hear the Virginia plantation-chorus of negroes, of a harvest night, in the glare of pine-knots;\nI hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men of Mannahatta;\nI hear the stevedores unlading the cargoes, and singing;\nI hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary north-west lakes;\nI hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as they strike the grain and grass with the showers of their terrible clouds;\nI hear the Coptic refrain, toward sundown, pensively falling on the breast of the black venerable vast mother, the Nile;\nI hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams of Kanada;\nI hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and the bells of the mule;\nI hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of the mosque;\nI hear the Christian priests at the altars of their churches I hear the responsive bass and soprano;\nI hear the wail of utter despair of the white-hair'd Irish grandparents, when they learn the death of their grandson;\nI hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's voice, putting to sea at Okotsk;\nI hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the slaves march on as the husky gangs pass on by twos and threes, fasten'd together with wrist-chains and ankle-chains;\nI hear the entreaties of women tied up for punishment I hear the sibilant whisk of thongs through the air;\nI hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms;\nI hear

salute you?\n\nI see a great round wonder rolling through the air;\nI see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards, jails, factories, palaces, hovels, huts of barbarians, tents of nomads, upon the surface;\nI see the shaded part on one side, where the sleepers are sleeping and the sun-lit part on the other side,\nI see the curious silent change of the light and shade,\nI see distant lands, as real and near to the inhabitants of them, as my land is to me.\n\nI see plenteous waters;\nI see mountain peaks I see the sierras of Andes and Alleghanies, where they range;\nI see plainly the

still;\nI see ten fishermen waiting they discover now a thick school of mossbonkers they drop the join'd seine-ends in the water,\nThe boats separate they diverge and row off, each on its rounding course to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers;\nThe net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,\nSome of the fishermen lounge in their boats others stand negligently ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs;\nThe boats are partly drawn up the water slaps against them;\nOn the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from the water, lie the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.\n\n\nI

have you reckon�d the earth much?\nHave you practis�d so long to learn to read?\nHave you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\n\nStop this day and night with me, and you shall possess the origin of all poems;\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left;)\nYou shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books;\nYou shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me:\nYou shall listen to all sides, and filter them from yourself.\n\nIII\n\nI have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end;\nBut I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\n\nThere was never any more inception than there is now,\nNor any more youth or age than there is now;\nAnd will never be any more perfection than there is now,\nNor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\n\nUrge, and urge, and urge;\nAlways the procreant urge of the world.\n\nOut of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex;\nAlways a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\n\nTo elaborate is no avail, learn�d and unlearn�d feel that it is so.\n\nSure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,\nStout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\nI and this mystery, here we stand.\n\nClear and sweet is my Soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my Soul.\n\nLack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\nTill that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its turn.\n\nShowing the best, and dividing it from the worst, age vexes age;\nKnowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\n\nWelcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean;\nNot an inch, nor a particle of an inch, is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.\n\nI am satisfied, I see, dance, laugh, sing:\nAs the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day, with stealthy tread,\nLeaving me baskets cover�d with white towels, swelling the house with their plenty,\nShall I postpone my acceptation and realization, and scream at my eyes,\nThat they turn from gazing after and down the road,\nAnd forthwith cipher and show me a cent,\nExactly the contents of one, and exactly the contents of two, and which is ahead?\n\nIV\n\nTrippers and askers surround me;\nPeople I meet, the effect upon me of my early life, or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,\nThe latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,\nMy dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\nThe real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\nThe sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or ill-doing, or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations;\nBattles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;\nThese come to me days and nights, and go from me again,\nBut they are not the Me myself.\n\nApart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am;\nStands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary;\nLooks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\nLooking with side-curved head, curious what will come next;\nBoth in and out of the game, and watching and wondering at it.\n\nBackward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders;\nI have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\n\nV\n\nI believe in you, my Soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you;\nAnd you must not be abased to the other.\n\nLoafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat;\nNot words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best;\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\n\nI mind how once we lay, such a transparent summer morning;\nHow you settled your head athwart my hips, and gently turn�d over upon me,\nAnd parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,\nAnd reach�d till you felt my beard, and reach�d till you held my feet.\n\n\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth;\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own;\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers;\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love;\nAnd limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the fields;\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them;\nAnd mossy scabs of the worm fence, and heap�d stones, elder, mullen and poke-weed.\n\nVI\n\nA child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is, any more than he.\n\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.\n\n\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\nA scented gift and remembrancer, designedly dropt,\nBearing the owner�s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say, Whose?\n\nOr I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.\n\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic;\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\nGrowing among black folks as among white;\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.\n\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you, curling grass;\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them;\nIt may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon out of their mothers� laps;\nAnd here you are the mothers� laps.\n\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers;\nDarker than the colorless beards of old men;\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\n\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.\n\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and children?\n\nThey are alive and well somewhere;\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death;\nAnd if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,\nAnd ceas�d the moment life appear�d.\n\nAll goes onward and outward, nothing collapses;\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\n\nVII\n\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\nI hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\n\nI pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash�d babe, and am not contain�d between my hat and boots;\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good;\nThe earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\n\nI am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself;\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\n\nEvery kind for itself and its own, for me mine, male and female;\nFor me those that have been boys, and that love women;\nFor me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted;\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers, and the mothers of mothers;\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears;\nFor me children, and the begetters of children.\n\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no;\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\n\nVIII\n\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle;\nI lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill;\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room;\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.\n\nThe blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders;\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor;\nThe snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs;\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous�d mobs;\nThe flap of the curtain�d litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital;\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall;\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd;\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes;\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv�d who fall sun-struck, or in fits;\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to babes;\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain�d by decorum;\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips;\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them, I come, and I depart.\n\nIX\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready;\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon;\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged;\nThe armfuls are pack�d to the sagging mow.\n\nI am there, I help, I came stretch�d atop of the load;\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other;\nI jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy,\nAnd roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\nX\n\nAlone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,\nWandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill�d game;\nFalling asleep on the gather�d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud;\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me;\nI tuck�d my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time:\n(You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.)\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl;\nHer father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders;\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand;\n\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach�d to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside;\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile;\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water, and fill�d a tub for his sweated body and bruis�d feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter�d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass�d north;\n(I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean�d in the corner.)\n\nXI\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;\nTwenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.\n\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;\nShe hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.\n\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you;\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten�d with wet, it ran from their long hair:\nLittle streams pass�d all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass�d over their bodies;\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them;\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch;\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\nXII\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market;\nI loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil;\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, (there is a great heat in the fire.)\n\nFrom the cinder-strew�d threshold I follow their movements;\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms;\nOver-hand the hammers swing, over-hand so slow, over-hand so sure:\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\nXIII\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain;\nThe negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands, pois�d on one leg on the string-piece;\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band;\n\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead;\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache, falls on the black of his polish�d and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant, and love him, and I do not stop there;\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward slueing;\nTo niches aside and junior bending.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble;\n\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing�d purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional;\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else;\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me;\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\nXIV\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night;\nYa-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;\n(The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close;\nI find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.)\n\nThe sharp-hoof�d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings;\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections;\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour�d of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses;\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me;\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me;\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will;\nScattering it freely forever.\n\nXV\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft;\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp;\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner;\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm;\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready;\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches;\nThe deacons are ordain�d with cross�d hands at the altar;\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel;\nThe farmer stops by the bars, as he walks on a First-day loafe, and looks at the oats and rye;\nThe lunatic is carried at last to the asylum, a confirm�d case,\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother�s bed-room;)\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,\nHe turns his quid of tobacco, while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;\nThe malform�d limbs are tied to the surgeon�s table,\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;\nThe quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove;\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass;\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to complete in the race;\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee;\nAs the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle;\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other;\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roof�d garret, and harks to the musical rain;\nThe Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron;\nThe squaw, wrapt in her yellow-hemm�d cloth, is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale;\nThe connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways;\nAs the deck-hands make fast the steamboat, the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers;\nThe young sister holds out the skein, while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots;\nThe one-year wife is recovering and happy, having a week ago borne her first child;\nThe clean-hair�d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine, or in the factory or mill;\nThe nine months� gone is in the parturition chamber, her faintness and pains are advancing;\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter�s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with red and gold;\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread;\nThe conductor beats time for the band, and all the performers follow him;\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions;\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, how the white sails sparkle!\nThe drover, watching his drove, sings out to them that would stray;\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)\nThe camera and plate are prepared, the lady must sit for her daguerreotype;\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly;\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open�d lips;\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck;\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other;\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths, nor jeer you;)\nThe President, holding a cabinet council, is surrounded by the Great Secretaries;\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms;\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold;\nThe Missourian crosses the plains, toting his wares and his cattle;\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train, he gives notice by the jingling of loose change;\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar;\nIn single file, each shouldering his hod, pass onward the laborers;\nSeasons pursuing each other, the indescribable crowd is gather�d, it is the Fourth of Seventh-month, (What salutes of cannon and small arms!)\nSeasons pursuing each other, the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface;\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe;\nFlatboatmen make fast, towards dusk, near the cottonwood or pekan-trees;\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river, or through those drain�d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansaw;\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahoochee or Altamahaw;\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them;\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day�s sport;\nThe city sleeps, and the country sleeps;\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time;\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife, and the young husband sleeps by his wife;\nAnd these one and all tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them;\nAnd such as it is to be of these, more or less, I am.\n\nXVI\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise;\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\nStuff�d with the stuff that is coarse, and stuff�d with the stuff that is fine;\nOne of the Great Nation, the nation of many nations, the smallest the same, and the largest the same;\nA southerner soon as a northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable, down by the Oconee I live;\nA Yankee, bound by my own way, ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth, and the sternest joints on earth;\nA Kentuckian, walking the vale of the Elkhorn, in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian;\nA boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes, or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland;\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking;\nAt home on the hills of Vermont, or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch;\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free north-westerners, (loving their big proportions;)\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat;\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest;\nA novice beginning, yet experient of myriads of seasons;\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion;\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker;\nA prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\n\nI resist anything better than my own diversity;\nI breathe the air, but leave plenty after me,\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place;\nThe suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are in their place;\nThe palpable is in its place, and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\nXVII\n\nThese are the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me;\nIf they are not yours as much as mine, they are nothing, or next to nothing;\nIf they are not the riddle, and the untying of the riddle, they are nothing;\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant, they are nothing.\n\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is, and the water is;\nThis is the common air that bathes the globe.\n\nXVIII\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play great marches for conquer�d and slain persons.\n\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.\n\nI beat and pound for the dead;\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.\n\nVivas to those who have fail�d!\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements!

Why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\n\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsell�d with doctors, and calculated close,\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\n\nIn all people I see myself, none more, and not one a barleycorn less;\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself, I say of them.\n\nAnd I know I am solid and sound;\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow;\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\n\nI know I am deathless;\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenter�s compass;\nI know I shall not pass like a child�s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.\n\nI know I am august;\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood;\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize;\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough;\nIf no other in the world be aware, I sit content;\nAnd if each and all be aware, I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware, and by far the largest to me, and that is myself;\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day, or in ten thousand or ten million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\n\nMy foothold is tenon�d and mortis�d in granite;\nI laugh at what you call dissolution;\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\nXXI\n\nI am the poet of the Body;\nAnd I am the poet of the Soul.\n\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with me;\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.\n\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man;\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man;\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride;\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough;\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? Are you the President?\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there, every one, and still pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night;\nI call to the earth and sea, half-held by the night.\n\nPress close, bare-bosom�d night! Press close, magnetic, nourishing night!\nNight of south winds! night of the large few stars!\nStill, nodding night! mad, naked, summer night.\n\nSmile, O voluptuous, cool-breath�d earth!\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees;\nEarth of departed sunset! earth of the mountains, misty-topt!\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just tinged with blue!\nEarth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river!\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and clearer for my sake!\nFar-swooping elbow�d earth! rich, apple-blossom�d earth!\nSmile, for your lover comes!\n\nProdigal, you have given me love! Therefore I to you give love!\nO unspeakable, passionate love!\n\nXXII\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you also, I guess what you mean;\nI behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers;\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me;\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land;\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse;\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretch�d ground-swells!\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths!\nSea of the brine of life! sea of unshovell�d yet always-ready graves!\nHowler and scooper of storms! capricious and dainty sea!\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase, and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation;\nExtoller of amies, and those that sleep in each others� arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy;\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house, and skip the house that supports them?)\n\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.\n\nWashes and razors for foofoos, for me freckles and a bristling beard.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\nEvil propels me, and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent;\nMy gait is no fault-finder�s or rejecter�s gait;\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work�d over and rectified?\n\nI find one side a balance, and the antipodal side a balance;\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine;\nThoughts and deeds of the present, our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past, or behaves well to-day, is not such a wonder;\nThe wonder is, always and always, how there can be a mean man or an infidel.\n\nXXIII\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks;\nHere or henceforward, it is all the same to me, I accept Time, absolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it rounds and completes all;\nThat mystic, baffling wonder I love, alone completes all.\n\nI accept reality, and dare not question it;\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\nFetch stonecrop, mixt with cedar and branches of lilac;\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches;\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas;\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.\n\nGentlemen! to you the first honors always:\nYour facts are useful and real, and yet they are not my dwelling;\n(I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.)\n\nLess the reminders of properties told, my words;\nAnd more the reminders, they, of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives, and them that plot and conspire.\n\nXXIV\n\nWalt Whitman am I, a Kosmos, of mighty Manhattan the son,\nTurbulent, fleshy and sensual, eating, drinking and breeding;\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women, or apart from them;\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me;\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.\n\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy;\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices;\nVoices of the interminable generations of slaves;\nVoices of prostitutes, and of deform�d persons;\nVoices of the diseas�d and despairing, and of thieves and dwarfs;\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs, and of the father-stuff,\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon;\nOf the trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices;\nVoice of sexes and lusts, voices veil�d, and I remove the veil;\nVoices indecent, by me clarified and transfigur�d.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth;\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart;\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites;\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch�d from;\nThe scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer;\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another, it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it.\n\nTranslucent mould of me, it shall be you!\nShaded ledges and rests, it shall be you!\nFirm masculine colter, it shall be you.\n\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me, it shall be you!\nYou my rich blood! Your milky stream, pale strippings of my life.\n\nBreast that presses against other breasts, it shall be you!\nMy brain, it shall be your occult convolutions.\n\nRoot of wash�d sweet flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\nMix�d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\nTrickling sap of maple! fibre of manly wheat! it shall be you!\n\nSun so generous, it shall be you!\nVapors lighting and shading my face, it shall be you!\nYou sweaty brooks and dews, it shall be you!\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me, it shall be you!\nBroad, muscular fields! branches of live oak! loving lounger in my winding paths! it shall be you!\nHands I have taken, face I have kiss�d, mortal I have ever touch�d! it shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me, and all so luscious;\nEach moment, and whatever happens, thrills me with joy.\n\nO I am wonderful!\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish;\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop! I pause to consider if it really be;\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows;\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world, at innocent gambols, silently rising, freshly exuding,\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs;\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction;\nThe heav�d challenge from the east that moment over my head;\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\nXXV\nDazzling and tremendous, how quick the sun-rise would kill me,\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\n\nWe also ascend, dazzling and tremendous as the sun;\nWe found our own, O my Soul, in the calm and cool of the daybreak.\n\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach;\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds, and volumes of worlds.\n\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself;\nIt provokes me forever;\nIt says sarcastically, Walt, you contain enough, why don�t you let it out, then?\n\nCome now, I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation.\n\nDo you not know, O speech, how the buds beneath you are folded?\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost;\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams;\nI underlying causes, to balance them at last;\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of things,\nHappiness, which, whoever hears me, let him or her set out in search of this day.\n\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am;\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me;\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.\n\nWriting and talk do not prove me;\nI carry the plenum of proof, and everything else, in my face;\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\nXXVI\n\nI think I will do nothing now but listen,\nTo accrue what I hear into myself, to let sounds contribute toward me.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals;\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice;\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following;\n\nSounds of the city, and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night;\n\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals;\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick;\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence;\nThe heave�e�yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters;\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts, with premonitory tinkles, and color�d lights;\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars;\nThe slow-march play�d at the head of the association, marching two and two,\n\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello (�tis the young man�s heart�s complaint;)\nI hear the key�d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears;\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera;\nAh, this indeed is music! This suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me;\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train�d soprano, (what work, with hers, is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies;\nIt wrenches such ardors from me, I did not know I possess�d them;\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick�d by the indolent waves;\nI am exposed, cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\nSteep�d amid honey�d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death;\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call being.\n\nXXVII\n\nTo be, in any form, what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither;)\nIf nothing lay more develop�d, the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell;\nI have instant conductors all over me, whether I pass or stop;\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy;\nTo touch my person to some one else�s is about as much as I can stand.\n\nXXVIII\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself;\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best, as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze at the edges of me;\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger;\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me;\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder;\nThey all come to the headland, to witness and assist against me.\n\nI am given up by traitors;\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor;\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.\n\nYou villian touch! what are you doing? My breath is tight in its throat;\nUnclench your floodgates! you are too much for me.\n\nXXIX\n\nBlind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath�d, hooded, sharp-tooth�d touch!\n\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting, track�d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan;\nRich, showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital:\nLandscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\nXXX\n\nAll truths wait in all things;\nThey neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist it;\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon;\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any;\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince;\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\nOnly what proves itself to every man and woman is so;\nOnly what nobody denies is so.\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain;\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,\nAnd until every one shall delight us, and we them.\n\nXXXI\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d�oeuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\nAnd the cow crunching with depress�d head surpasses any statue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels,\nAnd I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer�s girl boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake.\n\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,\nAnd am stucco�d with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nAnd call anything close again, when I desire it.\n\nIn vain the speeding or shyness;\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach;\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder�d bones;\nIn vain objects stand leagues off, and assume manifold shapes;\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great monsters lying low;\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky;\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs;\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods;\nIn vain the razor-bill�d auk sails far north to Labrador;\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\nXXXII\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain�d;\nI stand and look at them long and long.\n\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition;\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God;\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things;\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago;\nNot one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me, and I accept them;\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens:\nDid I pass that way huge times ago, and negligently drop them?\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them;\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers;\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate, as my heels embrace him;\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we race around and return.\n\nI but use you a moment, then I resign you, stallion;\nWhy do I need your paces, when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you.\n\nXXXIII\n\nO swift wind! O space and time! now I see it is true, what I guessed at;\nWhat I guess�d when I loaf�d on the grass;\nWhat I guess�d while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk�d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, I travel, I sail, my elbows rest in the sea-gaps;\nI skirt the sierras, my palms cover continents;\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city�s quadrangular houses, in log huts, camping with lumbermen;\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed;\nWeeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests;\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase;\nScorch�d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river;\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter;\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish;\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou;\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower�d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field;\nOver the sharp-peak�d farm house, with its scallop�d scum and slender shoots from the gutters;\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav�d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax;\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest;\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs;\nWalking the path worn in the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush;\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot;\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark;\nWhere flails keep time on the barn floor;\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow;\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides;\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders;\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs;\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself, and looking composedly down;)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand;\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it;\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke;\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water;\nWhere the half-burn�d brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr�d flag is borne at the head of the regiments;\nApproaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island;\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance;\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside;\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good game of base-ball;\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter;\nAt the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw;\nAt apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find;\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings:\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps;\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scattered, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel;\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen;\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks;\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie;\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near;\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding;\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh;\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high weeds;\n\nWhere band-neck�d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out;\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch�d gates of a cemetery;\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees;\nWhere the yellow-crown�d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs;\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon;\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well;\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves;\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs;\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain�d saloon, through the office or public hall;\nPleas�d with the native, and pleas�d with the foreign, pleas�d with the new and old;\nPleas�d with women, the homely as well as the handsome;\nPleas�d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously;\nPleas�d with the tune of the choir of the white-wash�d church;\nPleas�d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any preacher, impress�d seriously at the camp-meeting:\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate-glass;\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn�d up to the clouds,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle:\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek�d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day;)\nFar from the settlements, studying the print of animals� feet, or the moccasin print;\nBy the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a feverish patient;\nNigh the coffin�d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle:\nVoyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure;\nHurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any;\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him;\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while;\nWalking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side;\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars;\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles;\nSpeeding with tail�d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest;\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly;\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing;\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product:\nAnd look at quintillions ripen�d, and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul;\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial;\nNo guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only;\nMy messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck;\nI take my place late at night in the crow�s-nest;\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough;\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty;\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions;\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them;\n(We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged;\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution;\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin�d city;\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.)\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires.\n\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself;\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife�s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs;\nThey fetch my man�s body up, dripping and drown�d.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times;\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm;\nHow he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk�d in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you:\nHow he follow�d with them, and tack�d with them, and would not give it up;\nHow he saved the drifting company at last:\nHow the lank loose-gown�d women look�d when boated from the side of their prepared graves;\nHow the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp�d unshaved men:\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine;\nI am the man, I suffer�d, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of olden martyrs;\nThe mother, condemn�d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on;\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover�d with sweat;\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets;\nAll these I feel, or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen;\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn�d with the ooze of my skin;\nI fall on the weeds and stones;\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments;\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person;\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash�d fireman with breast-bone broken;\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris;\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades;\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;\nThey have clear�d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake;\nPainless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy;\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps;\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate;\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort�s bombardment;\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers;\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars;\nAgain, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part, I see and hear the whole;\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim�d shots;\nThe ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs;\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion;\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand;\nHe gasps through the clot, Mind not me, mind, the entrenchments.\n\nXXXIV\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth;\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo;)\n�Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.\n\nRetreating, they had form�d in a hollow square, with their baggage for breastworks;\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy�s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance;\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone;\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv�d writing and seal, gave up their arms, and march�d back prisoners of war.\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers;\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and massacred, it was beautiful early summer;\nThe work commenced about five o�clock, and was over by eight.\n\nNone obey�d the command to kneel;\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight;\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together;\nThe maim�d and mangled dug in the dirt, the newcomers saw them there;\nSome, half-kill�d, attempted to crawl away;\nThese were despatch�d with bayonets, or batter�d with the blunts of muskets;\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz�d his assassin till two more came to release him;\nThe three were all torn, and cover�d with the boy�s blood.\n\nAt eleven o�clock began the burning of the bodies:\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\nXXXV\n\nWould you hear of an old-fashion�d sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the story as my grandmother�s father, the sailor, told it to me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said he;)\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower�d eve he came, horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch�d;\nMy captain lash�d fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv�d some eighteen pound shots under the water;\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around, and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark;\nTen o�clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported;\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold, to give them a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces, they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire;\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck, and the fighting is done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use;\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy�s mainmast;\nTwo, well served with grape and canister, silence his musketry and clear his decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top;\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment�s cease;\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\n\n\nSerene stands the little captain;\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low;\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve at night, there in the beams of the moon, they surrender to us.\n\nXXXVI\n\nStretch�d and still lies the midnight;\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness;\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer�d;\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet;\nNear by, the corpse of the child that serv�d in the cabin;\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl�d whiskers;\nThe flames, spite of all that can be done, flickering aloft and below;\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty;\nFormless stacks of bodies, and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\nThe hiss of the surgeon�s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan;\nThese so, these irretrievable.\n\nXXXVII\n\nO Christ! This is mastering me!\nIn at the conquer�d doors they crowd. I am possess�d.\n\nI embody all presences outlaw�d or suffering;\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\n\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch;\nIt is I let out in the morning, and barr�d at night.\n\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff�d to jail, but I am handcuff�d to him and walk by his side;\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one, with sweat on my twitching lips.)\n\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I also lie at the last gasp;\nMy face is ash-color�d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me, and I am embodied i",
